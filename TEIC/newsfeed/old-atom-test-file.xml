<p>Here is good news for everyone who is considering to submit a late-breaking proposal for the TEI members meeting 2010 in Zadar, Croatia (Nov. 8 to 14):</p>
<p>We now started to accept proposals at the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/conftool">TEI conference management tool</a>. The official closing date for this is September 30th, 2010.</p>
<p>Late-breaking proposals are screened by the Programme Committee and do not undergo the peer-review process of the regular submissions, thus also do not qualify for automatic consideration for the conference volume.  More information about the conference is <a href="http://ling.unizd.hr/%7Etei2010/index.en.html">here</a>, the call for late-breaking proposals is <a href="http://ling.unizd.hr/%7Etei2010/call4latebreakingproposals/index.en.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="http://ling.unizd.hr/%7Etei2010/workshops/index.en.html">excellent slate of workshops on offer</a> for this year&#8217;s conference, for which the <a href="http://tei-shop.org/">early bird rate offering discounts of up to 20% is still available</a>.  Yet another good reason to consider coming to Zadar this year and catch up with what is going on in the text encoding community!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Christian Wittern<br />
Chair, TEI MM2010 International Programme Committee</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/tei/2010/08/23/announcing-preliminary-dissemination-of-an-interview-with-julia-flanders/"><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SIG/Education/">TEI Education SIG</a>, I am pleased to announce preliminary dissemination of &#8220;An Interview with Julia Flanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure that anyone who may wish to access the piece for teaching (or other) purposes can do so even before the work finds a more permanent home, the interviewee has graciously granted me permission to share it informally via blog post. The related links (including a brief, informal introduction; the questions; the transcript and podcast; and the TEI-XML version) can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/An_Interview_with_Julia_Flanders">TEI Education SIG wiki page.</a></p>
<p>As indicated in the interview introduction, Julia’s comments are thought-provoking and profoundly significant, the kind that urgently warrant dissemination, but I hope nonetheless that they will come to represent only one part of a larger, ongoing conversation about TEI and DH.</p>
<p>Questions, comments, suggestions, etc. are warmly welcomed &#8211;</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />
Stephanie Schlitz</p>

See the news announcement for links to the registration and conference sites (<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/News/#tei-2010-07-21-tei_2010_conference_meeting_and_workshops_registration_opens).">http://www.tei-c.org/News/#tei-2010-07-21-tei_2010_conference_meeting_and_workshops_registration_opens</a>).</p>
<p>As was the case last year, you can register for the conference and workshops using your credit card. Significant discounts are available for those who register before September 7th; Members and subscribers of the TEI also receive additional steep discounts on the price of<br />
registration.</p>
<p>We will be posting the conference schedule soon. The workshop schedule is already available at <a href="http://ling.unizd.hr/~tei2010/workshops/index.en.html">http://ling.unizd.hr/~tei2010/workshops/index.en.html</a> As you will see, we have an extremely exciting range of workshops directed by leaders in the TEI and wider XML communities. There are workshops that are suitable for newcomers to the TEI and world of XML more generally as well as workshops on advanced topics in both the TEI and XML processing. Several workshops are likely to be of interest to members of the wider community. Workshops range from a single 1/2 day to 1.5 days in length. The price for members and subscribers is $60/half-day with an additional 20% discount for registrations before September 7th. You do not need to register for a workshop in order to attend the conference; and you may register for a workshop without attending the conference.</p>
<p>You can register for the conference and workshops and become an individual subscriber to the TEI through our on-line store: <a href="http://tei-shop.org.">http://tei-shop.org.</a> For information on becoming an institutional member of the TEI and gaining access to additional benefits like our new  AccessTEI programme (<a>http://accessTEI.apexcovantage.com/),</a> contact the membership secretary (membership@tei-c.org).</p>

Interedition Workshop  at the National Library of Israel, 6-7 October</p>
<p>The ESF COST Action Interedition is delighted to offer several bursaries for a workshop to be held at the National Library of Israel, 6-7 October 2010.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="http://www.interedition.eu/">Interedition</a> is to promote the interoperability of the tools and methodology used in the field of digital scholarly editing and research. Equally, Interedition seeks to raise the awareness of the importance of sustainability of the digital artefacts and instruments we create. To this end, Intereditions is hosting this workshop at the National Library of Israel to explore the tools, methodologies, and approaches to better support a shared model for the creation of sustainable infrastructure for digital text.</p>
<p>Applications are being accepted for bursaries for early stage researchers to attend this two-day event which will include lectures by leading textual scholars (including Dirk Van Hulle, Fotis Jannidis, Susan Schreibman, and Joris van Zundert) The first day will focus on lectures on topics ranging from the creation and futures of digital scholarly editions, to the tools being used to create and edit them. The second day will be hands-on centering on practical experience in using tools and methodologies central to the discipline, including TEI, eLaborate, and CollateX. On day II attendees will participate in a project slam and there will be ample opportunity to discuss their editing projects with workshop facilitators.</p>
<p>To apply for busaries, candidates must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an emerging scholar, which is defined by the ESF as someone who has not been in an established position for more than five years, with exceptions for parental, medical, and national service leaves. The ESF notes that ‘students, post-doctorate researchers and lecturers within 5 years of appointment would be amongst those included in this definition’.</li>
<li>you are affiliated to a an institution in a country in which ESF has a  member organisation (see <a href="http://www.esf.org/about-us/80-member-organisations.html&gt;">http://www.esf.org/about-us/80-member-organisations.html;</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bursaries will be awarded in two categories: up to €300 for Israeli delegates and up to €1200 for European delegates to cover housing and travel costs. Expenses will be reimbursed after the event in line with COST procedures.</p>
<p>If you fit the above criteria and would like to apply for consideration, please send no more than two pages that include the following: a) a brief  CV showing your career history and current academic affiliation; and b) how  this workshop will intersect with your research. Please send your application to susan.schreibman[AT]gmail.com no later than 24 August.</p>

<p>As news editor, you would</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist in posting TEI Consortium announcements to the news server</li>
<li>Act as a contact person and moderator for outside organisations that wish to post to our &#8220;Other News&#8221; section, ensuring that such announcements are relevant and useful to our community</li>
<li>Monitor the TEI&#8217;s mailing list (TEI-L@listserv.brown.edu) for announcements, calls for papers, and the like that might make suitable postings to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking for two or three volunteers for this position, ideally in different time zones in order to ensure timely response to new postings.</p>
<p>We expect the positions to involve no more than an hour or two a week of work, which could easily be combined with one&#8217;s daily email routine.</p>
<p>The positions might be especially suitable for graduate students, post-docs, or relative newcomers to the field who would like an opportunity to get to know better the breadth of activity in the TEI community. It is also an opportunity for more experienced members of the community to help out the TEI in a way that involves less of a time commitment than serving on the Council or Board.</p>
<p>If you are interested in these positions, or would like to nominate somebody else, please contact the webmaster at <a href="mailto:news@tei-c.org">news@tei-c.org</a>.</p>

The meeting will  take place November  11-14 at the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Zadar&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=41.818029,85.78125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.111685,15.225538&amp;spn=0.004645,0.010471&amp;z=17">University   of Zadar</a>, Zadar Croatia. Pre-conference Workshops will be held   November 8-10.</p>
<p>The theme of the conference is &#8220;TEI  Applied: Digital Texts and Language Resources,&#8221; though papers and  posters on other subjects are also included.</p>
<p>The conference programme includes two keynote lectures, twenty-one regular papers in parallel sessions (with additional space being held back for our<a href="http://ling.unizd.hr/~tei2010/call4latebreakingproposals/index.en.html"> September call for &#8220;late breaking&#8221; papers</a>), numerous posters and demos, and a number of five minute micro-paper+poster demonstrations of the use of TEI XML. And of course there will be the TEI&#8217;s famous &#8220;poster-slam&#8221; where presenters have one minute to discuss their paper in a plenary session, will also be held. The annual TEI members meeting will be held at this conference and the results of the annual election for board and council will be announced.</p>
<p>Our keynote speakers for 2010 are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tomaž Erjavec</strong> (Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia)</li>

MEI 2010-05, a groundbreaking digital musical notation model

The MEI Council is pleased to announce the first
collaboratively-designed method for encoding the intellectual and
physical characteristics of music notation documents and
their scholarly editorial apparatus. MEI has the ability
to manage complex source situations and will dramatically improve
the search, retrieval and display of notated music online,
benefiting music scholars and performers.
Because of MEI's software independence, the data format defined
by the schema also serves an archival function. 

The MEI model is free and available for download at
<a href="http://music-encoding.org/">http://music-encoding.org</a>. The site also offers tutorials, examples,
and experimental software for MEI conversion--more will be available
in the near future. Information about the future of the project
and how to get involved are also on the site.

The MEI Council is an international group of scholars,
technologists, and educators representing a broad range of
musicological, theoretical, and pedagogical interests. The Council
was created through funding to the University of Virginia Library
and the University of Paderborn from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) and the
National Endowment for the Humanities.</pre>

Example: <a href="http://www.teibyexample.org">http://www.teibyexample.org</a>.</p>
<p>TEI By Example (TBE) offers a series of freely available online tutorials<br />
walking individuals through the different stages in marking up a document<br />
in <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)</a>. Besides a general introduction to text<br />
encoding, step-by-step tutorial modules provide example-based<br />
introductions to eight different aspects of electronic text markup for the<br />
humanities. Each tutorial module is accompanied with a dedicated examples<br />
section, illustrating actual TEI encoding practise with real-life<br />
examples. The theory of the tutorial modules can be tested in interactive<br />
tests and exercises. The tutorial materials are contextualised with a TBE<br />
validator application, allowing you to test your TEI encoding as you type!</p>
<p>We hope you will consider using TEI by Example in your (online)teaching<br />
and refer students of markup to these tutorials.<br />
We also hope you will submit more examples of encoding for inclusion in TBE.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re eager to receive your comments and learn about your use of TEI by<br />
example in (self-)teaching environments.</p>
<p>Please contact the editorial team with any feedback at <a href="mailto:">teibyexample@kantl.be</a>.</p>
<p>Funding for the project has been made available by the Association of<br />
Literary and Linguistic Computing, the Centre for Computers and the<br />
Humanities &#8211; King&#8217;s College London, UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, and<br />

the official journal of the TEI Consortium</p>
<p>The TEI Board is delighted to announce a call for papers for the inaugural issue of The Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative. The journal will be published at least once a year with papers from the previous year’s TEI Conference and Members&#8217; Meeting. The editors also welcome proposals from members of the community to guest-edit a special issue on a particular topic or theme of interest<br />
for TEI scholarship, methods, or practice. This is a freely-available, open-access, peer-reviewed journal hosted by <a href="http://www.revues.org">Revues.org</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on the journal, see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a id="z5a1" style="color: #551a8b;" title="journal.tei-c.org" href="http://journal.tei-c.org/">http://journal.tei-c.org/</a> . Detailed submission instructions will be made available at this site in the near future.For this inaugural issue, the guest editors (Syd Bauman, Kevin Hawkins, and Malte Rehbein) welcome any article that<br />
takes as its premise the scholarly, pedagogic, or administrative concerns of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines or the Text<br />
Encoding Initiative Consortium. Articles arising from the 2009 Conference and Members Meeting held in Ann Arbor are especially welcome.</p>
<p>Closing date for submissions for the inaugural issue is 30 October 2010 with publication expected late Winter 2011.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/tei/2010/07/08/p5-release-1-7-now-available/"><![CDATA[<p>TEI P5 release 1.7.0  is now available from Sourceforge at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tei/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tei/files/</a> and also online at  <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html</a></p>
<p>This release introduces significant additional features to the way in which the ODD system for TEI customization may be expressed. The new features introduced allow a customization to be expressed by inclusion (specifying only the elements it requires) rather than by exclusion (specifying the elements which it does not require). They also permit specification of a particular version of the Guidelines as source for a schema.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Support for this entailed a number of changes, including definition of new attributes for &lt;moduleRef&gt;, and new elements &lt;elementRef&gt;, &lt;macroRef&gt; and &lt;classRef&gt; as well as revision to the prose of the relevant Guidelines chapters. Some clarification of the way the odd-to-odd transformation process works, for example when generating pattern prefixes for RelaxNG, was also necessary. The new features greatly simplify the process of generating user specific customizations, while retaining all the existing behaviours. In addition, the test suite has been revised and extended to check that the new facilities worked as intended. Expanded tutorial material for the revised system will be the subject of a Workshop to be taught at the 2010 General Meeting.</p>
<p>As usual, several minor clarifications and corrections were made to the wording of the Guidelines in response to Sourceforge tickets (e.g. 3025031 3025032 3025017 3010481 2989088 2982439 2942469 2965680 2981703 2982056) and discussion on Council and TEI-L mailing lists.</p>
<p>The work of the AFNOR group providing and correcting French translations and examples also continued; in particular during May and June substantial work on a new suite of French language examples was undertaken.</p>
<p>A small number of other minor changes are listed below in reverse date order:</p>
<ul>
<li> 2010-07-02 : add constraint to prevent &lt;relateditem&gt; supplying both a @target and some content (2728061)</li>
<li> 2010-05-08 : add new source attribute and revise datatype of  existing version attributes for consistency</li>
<li> 2010-05-06 : add new att.docStatus attribute class (2812634)</li>
<li> 2010-05-06 : add &lt;material&gt; to att.canonical class (2811234)</li>
<li> 2010-05-01 : rationalise and make consistent datatype of the @target attribute (2531384)</li>
<li> 2010-05-01 : revised class memberships for consistency amongst elements which can appear within choice (2834505)</li>
<li> 2010-04-30 : new attribute @points  added to att.coordinated to enable definition of non-rectangular zones in facsimile (2971316)</li>
<li> 2010-04-30 : added &lt;idno&gt; to model.nameLike, thus permitting use of standard identifiers of various kinds in &lt;person, &lt;place etc. (2949985)</li>
<li> 2010-04-30 : add &lt;ref&gt; wherever &lt;title&gt; is permitted in high level components of &lt;biblstruct&gt; (2976608)</li>
<li> 2010-04-06 : make @url mandatory and scaling attributes optional for all graphic elements (2965521)</li>
</ul>

<p>The TEI @ Oxford Summer School is a three day course introducing the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for encoding of digital text. It combines in-depth coverage of the latest version of the TEI Recommendations for the encoding of digital text with practical workshops on related technologies. It<br />
includes an introduction to mark-up, explanations of the TEI Guidelines, and approaches to publishing TEI texts. Practical exercises expose you hands-on experience of a wide range of TEI customisation, editing, and publication.</p>
<p>Each day will also include a number of afternoon 2.5 hour parallel workshops on related technologies and topics. These will include  TEI Publishing; TEI for Language Resources; Transforming TEI with XSLT; TEI in Libraries; Creating a TEI-based Website with the eXist XML Database; and Genetic Editing: transcribing<br />
documents, transcribing the process.   There will also be optional surgery sessions for those who wish to consult with TEI@Oxford about their particular projects or encoding issues. There will also be guest lectures from Digital Humanities experts familiar with the TEI talking about their own projects, including C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen (co-editor of the XML Spec and one of the founding editors of the TEI).</p>
<p>If you are a project manager, research assistant, or encoder working on any kind of project concerned with the creation or management of digital text, this course is for you.</p>
<p>The course runs from Monday 12 July &#8211; Wednesday 14 July, 2010. The course runs from 09:30 &#8211; 17:30 each day in our fully-equipped computer training rooms. Lunch and refreshments are included in the course fee.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/tei/2010/06/14/new-tei-newsfeed/"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the TEI-C website now has a new Newsfeed system.  This should allow quicker and easier posting of news items to the TEI-C website sidebar and TEI News Page [1].  Although it appears entirely integral to the TEI-C website, it is in fact drawn from our Sourceforge project and based on a wordpress blog there to enable easier posting.  As the TEI Sourceforge admins can delegate posting to the newsfeed there, it means that more volunteers will eventually be able to post news without needing access to the CMS system that the TEI website uses.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to an atom [2]  or RSS [3] feed on the sourceforge site if you wish to consume TEI News directly.</p>
<p>For those interested in the technical details, what happens is that at a regular interval the Atom feed is grabbed from the Sourceforge site and then transformed (with XSLT) to some XHTML fragments of either a list of headlines or the News page content itself.  These are then dynamically included in the appropriate pages inside the OpenCMS system that the TEI-C website currently uses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a number of bugs will rear their heads as soon as this is announced, do feel free to report them on the TEI-L list, on Sourceforge or to me directly.  (Note: It is known that some of the dates are wrong on early posts, they were imported to wordpress without dates.)</p>
<p>Many thanks to David Sewell for his assistance with integrating this with OpenCMS.</p>

<p>AccessTEI is a digitization program that allows member institutions of the TEI to realize saving and workflow efficiencies in the outsourcing of digitization work normally available only to the largest and most active of institutions. By taking advantage of economies of scale among the TEI membership, AccessTEI is able to offer preferred pricing even on very small jobs—while still providing users with access to individual project management and Quality Assurance programs. Pricing is set by the output kilobyte, providing cost certainty.</p>
<div id="attachment_146" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-146" title="MyAccount" src="https://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/tei/nfs/project/t/te/tei/uploads/2010/06/MyAccount-300x173.png" alt="The AccessTEI Project Management Interface" width="300" height="173" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The AccessTEI Project Management Interface</p></div>
<p>Using the <a href="http://accesstei.apexcovantage.com/">AccessTEI web portal</a> member institutions submit work for digitization. In recognition of the fact that TEI members work with a wide variety of content, AccessTEI accepts a very wide variety of original documents from modern print to manuscript and in western and non-western character sets. An <a href="http://accesstei.apexcovantage.com/Home/PriceMatrix">innovative pricing matrix</a> allows users to determine the cost effectiveness of any particular job, ensuring that limited resources (including the time of skilled researchers) are applied with maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Submissions to this program are encoded in TEI Tite, a special TEI-developed customization developed to ensure maximum keyboarding efficiency. Users can easily transform documents encoded in Tite into TEI P5 XML or other standard markup languages.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:membership@tei-c.org">Contact the TEI</a> to learn about how your project can become a member in order to take advantage of this program. Already a member? <a href="mailto:membership@tei-c.org">Contact us</a> to set up your AccessTEI account.</p>

<p>The start of submissions will probably be at the beginning of August and will be announced here as well, today&#8217;s message is just to inform you of this possibility, which will come as a relief to those who missed the deadline of the first round of submissions, but still would like to have a chance to contribute to the program of the meeting.</p>
<p>There will also be an exciting slate of pre-conference workshops to be announced really soon now, so please watch this space, or the conference website for further information.</p>
<p>For the programme commmittee,</p>

<p>Publicising your use of the TEI is an                     important part of ensuring the continuing viability  of the TEI community and the                     TEI&#8217;s profile within your discipline. The code  snippets associated with each                     button direct users to the TEI website, encouraging  your visitors and                     colleagues to investigate the use of the TEI for  their own digital work.</p>
<p><a name="d3876716e99"><!--anchor--></a>In contrast to buttons  published by organisations like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),  these TEI buttons do not make any specific claims about                     <em>how</em> the TEI is being used by a project. The  TEI is used in so many                     different ways by so many different organisations  that it would be                     next-to-impossible to establish a series of buttons  associated with a specific                     validation programme or to describe specific types  of usage. For us, it is                     enough that you use the TEI in your project.</p>

Library and Northwestern University.</li>
<li>Pisa, Italy, November 16-17 2001. Hosted by the University<br />
of Pisa.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site of the conference and meeting has typically alternated between Europe and<br />
North America, but that is not a fixed rule. We welcome proposals<br />
from other parts of the world, and in particular from areas where<br />
new TEI communities are arising.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s conference and meeting will be a four-day event (plus pre-conference<br />
workshops), with approximately 120 attendees. The three days of the<br />
main conference will include a mix of plenary lectures by invited<br />
speakers, round-table discussions, and conference-style sessions;<br />
there will also be a business meeting of the membership. The fourth<br />
day (Sunday) will be a closed session for members of the Board.<br />
Meetings of TEI Special Interest Groups (SIGs) may also scheduled<br />
for this day. Future meetings should assume roughly this shape,<br />
although there is considerable room for local initiative in<br />
consultation with the Board.</p>
<p>The TEI Consortium guarantees direct costs of the conference and<br />
meeting up to a maximum of US$5200 with special provisions for<br />
funding attendance in excess of approximately 120 attendees. The<br />
conference organising committee is also expected to seek additional<br />
funds from local institutions, commercial sponsors, and other<br />
organisations. A conference registration fee is charged to assist<br />
the TEI in recovering its expenditure and ensure that it is able to<br />
underwrite the cost of future conferences.</p>
<p>Bids should be sent to info@tei-c.org by no later than September 1,<br />
2009, though institutions considering making a proposal are<br />
encouraged to contact chair of the TEI (<a title="daniel.odonnell@uleth.ca" href="mailto:daniel.odonnell@uleth.ca" target="_top">daniel.odonnell@uleth.ca</a>) much earlier in the process in<br />
order to discuss their ideas. Bids should include the following<br />
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the institution(s) making the bid</li>
<li>The name, address, email, and telephone number of the<br />
contact person</li>
<li>A brief description of the facilities available for the<br />
event (rooms, equipment, technical support, food)</li>
<li>An indication of what financial support, if any, the<br />
hosting institution is prepared to give (for instance,<br />
sponsoring one or more receptions or pre-meeting workshops;<br />
payment of travel expenses for one or more plenary speakers;<br />
etc.)</li>
<li>Any other details that may be useful in assessing the bid<br />
(e.g. the presence of a conference on a related topic at the<br />
institution around the time of the meeting; the launch of a<br />
new TEI-related initiative at the institution, etc., ideas<br />
for a particular theme or focus).</li>
</ul>
<p>In submitting bids, local organisers are encouraged to be<br />
creative: the TEI is willing to work with hosts to reflect local<br />
interests and strengths.</p>
<p>Further information about the requirements for the conference and members meeting<br />
may be found in our document on <a title="Hosting a Members Meeting" href="http://www.tei-c.org/Membership/Meetings/meeting_hosting.xml" target="_top">Hosting a Members<br />

Procedures</a> document.</p>
<p>All bids will be reviewed by the TEI board, which makes the final<br />
decision.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, the<br />
TEI Conference and Members&#8217; Meeting has been preceded by educational workshops.<br />
The goal of these workshops is to give members of the TEI community an<br />
opportunity to learn more about the use of the TEI markup under the guidance of<br />
experienced instructors and practitioners. In the past such workshops have<br />
ranged from a basic introduction to the use of TEI markup to more specialized<br />
sessions on specific aspects of the TEI or its use in specific domains. They<br />
have ranged in length from a single morning or afternoon to a maximum of two<br />
days. Workshops are run on a cost-recovery basis: a separate fee is charged of<br />
participants that is intended to cover the costs of running the workshop.</p>
<p>We are now soliciting proposals for workshops for the 2009 Conference<br />
and Members&#8217; Meeting, to be held November 11-15 in Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA).<br />
Workshops are distinct from other conference activities, such as papers,<br />
sessions, and Special Interest Group meetings. They should be educational in<br />
focus and propose topics that are likely to be of interest to recognizable<br />
segments of the TEI community [...]</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/tei/1970/01/01/call-for-participation-advanced-seminars-in-tei-encoding/"><![CDATA[<p>
                Applications are invited for participation in a new series of advanced text<br />
                encoding seminars, sponsored by the Brown University Women Writers Project with<br />
                generous funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. </p>
<div class="p">
                These seminars assume a basic familiarity with TEI, and provide an opportunity<br />
                to explore specific encoding topics in more detail, in a collaborative workshop<br />
                setting. Each seminar will focus on one of two topics:
<ol>
<li>
                Manuscript encoding: focusing on the detailed challenges of encoding<br />
                manuscript materials, including editorial, transcriptional, and<br />
                interpretive issues and the methods of representing these in TEI markup. </li>
<li>
                Contextual information: focusing on TEI methods for formalizing and<br />
                representing information about context: named entities such as people<br />
                and places, thematic analysis and keywords, text classification,<br />
                glossaries and annotations. </li>
</ol>
<p> These seminars are intended to provide a more in-depth look at specific<br />
                encoding problems and topics for people who are already involved in a text<br />
                encoding project or are in the process of planning one. Each event will include<br />
                a mix of presentations, discussion, case studies using participants&#8217; projects,<br />
                hands-on practice, and individual consultation. The seminars will be strongly<br />
                project-based: participants will present their projects to the group, discuss<br />
                specific challenges and encoding strategies, develop encoding specifications and<br />
                documentation, and create encoded sample documents and templates. We encourage<br />
                project teams and collaborative groups to apply, although individuals are also<br />
                welcome. A basic knowledge of the TEI Guidelines and some prior experience with<br />
                text encoding (e.g. an introductory workshop, job experience, etc.) will be<br />
                assumed. </p></div>
<p>
                Travel funding is available of up to $500 per participant. </p>
<p>
                Dates, locations, and application deadlines are below. For information on how to<br />
