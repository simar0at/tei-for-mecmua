printing at 10. Finished by lunch time, except 20 sheets; then in 1/4 hour
afterwards finished. Better printing than last time: due to frequent dry
pulls in the early stages. This is the first thing we have printed since
1933. Decision to buy a bull-dog: partly as a friend for the cats, partly
to keep off orange &amp; melon thieves. To be called <q>Folly.</q></p>

          <p>Went to sea: brought back cuttlefish for ink-stains, and a bunch

          <p>German royalty accounts 3108 marks: but how to get it from

<note>Must have been royalty payments on the translation of the
