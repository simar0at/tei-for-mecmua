            <p>The building is typically described as being 102 stories tall, although it has only 85

            <p>The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building for a record 41 years. It was

            1972, and the <name type="place">Sears Tower</name> shortly afterwards. With the
            destruction of the World Trade Center in the <date value="2001-09-11">September 11,
            2001</date> attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New

            <label>Construction</label>
            <p>The Empire State Building was designed by <name type="person">William Lamb</name> of the
            architectural firm <name type="firm">Shreve, Lamb and Harmon</name>. His design was
            influenced by the perpendicular style of another architect, <name type="person">Eliel
                Saarinen</name>. He happened to base most of his design on a simple pencil. The
            clean, soaring lines inspired him, and he modeled the building after it.</p>
            <p>The general contractors were <name type="firm">Starrett Brothers and Eken</name>, and the
            project was financed by <name type="person">John J. Raskob</name> and <name type="person">Pierre S. DuPont</name>. The construction company was chaired by <name type="person">Alfred E. Smith</name>, a former Governor of New York. Excavation of
            the site began on <date value="1930-01-22">January 22, 1930</date>, and construction on
            the building itself started on <date value="1930-03-17">March 17</date>. The project
            involved 3400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of <name type="tribe">Mohawk nation</name> iron workers. According to official accounts, five
            workers died during the construction.</p>
            <p>The building was officially opened on <date value="1931-05-01">May 1, 1931</date> in
            dramatic fashion, when President <name type="person">Herbert Hoover</name> turned on the
            building's lights with the push of a button from <name type="place">Washington,
            D.C.</name></p>

            <p>At 9:49 a.m. on Saturday <date value="1945-07-28">July 28, 1945</date>, a B-25 Mitchell
            bomber piloted by Lieutenant Colonel <name type="person">William F. Smith Jr.</name>
            accidentally crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th
            and 80th floors, where the offices of the <name type="org">Catholic War Relief
            Office</name> were located. One engine shot through the side opposite the impact and
            another plummeted down an elevator shaft. The fire was extinguished in 40 minutes.
            Fourteen people were killed in the incident. Despite the damage and loss of life, the
            building was open for business on many floors on the following Monday.</p>
            <p>Elevator operator <name type="person">Betty Lou Oliver</name> survived a plunge of 75
