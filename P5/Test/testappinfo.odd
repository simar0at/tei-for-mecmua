<p>The minutes of the TEI Council meeting in April 2007 record
<quote>
A new <gi>tei:appInfo</gi> element will be created that is a member of
<name type="class">model.encodingPart</name>, which contains one or
more occurrences of a new element, <gi>application</gi> that can be
used by programs to record information intended for other
programs. The content of <gi>application</gi>, like <gi>egXML</gi>,
must be well-formed XML, but no further constraints are placed on it
at this time. It is a future work item to develop a mechanism to
associate an <gi>application</gi> with an actual particular
program.</quote>

  <p>Here is the schema:</p>
    <schemaSpec ident="testappinfo" start="TEI">
      <moduleRef key="header"/>
      <moduleRef key="core"/>
      <moduleRef key="tei"/>
      <moduleRef key="textstructure"/>
      <elementSpec ident="appInfo" mode="add">
	    <gloss>application information</gloss>
	    <desc>records information about an application which has
	    edited the TEI file. </desc>
	<classes>
	  <memberOf key="model.encodingPart"/>
	</classes>
	<content>
	  <rng:oneOrMore>
	    <rng:ref name="model.applicationLike"/>
	  </rng:oneOrMore>
	</content>
	<remarks><p>The main purposes of this element are: 1) to allow an
	application to discover that it has previously
	opened/edited a file, and what version of itself was used
	to do that; 2) to show (through a date) which
	application last edited the file to allow for diagnosis of
	any problems that might have been caused by that
	application; 3) to allow users to discover information
	about an application used to edit the file; 4) to allow
	the application to declare an interest in elements of
	the file which it has edited, so that other applications
	or human editors may be more wary of making changes to
	those sections of the file. The <att>xml:id</att> attribute should be
	used to store a string which uniquely identifies the
	application and its major version number (for example,
	<hi>ImageMarkupTool1</hi>) and applications should ensure that
	only one such tag appears in the file for any given major
	version of the application.</p></remarks>

	  <p>This example shows an appInfo tag describing an
