        <p>TEI Lite was the name adopted for what the TEI editors originally
conceived of as a simple demonstration of how the TEI encoding scheme
might be adopted to meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user
community. In retrospect, it was predictable that many people should
imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far
too heavy for their needs (to meet the latter criticism, Michael also
prepared a special <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Bare">barebones version of TEI
Lite</ref>).</p>
        <p>TEI Lite was based largely on our observations of existing and
previous practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest
in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford
Text Archive</ref> and in our own experience. It is therefore
unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a de facto standard,
at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and
encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced
this shortish, readable, manual for it also helped.</p>

<p>That manual was, of course, authored and is maintained in the DTD
it describes, originally as <ref target="teiu5_en.xml">an XML
document</ref>. This makes it easy to produce a number of differently
formatted versions in HTML, PDF, etc., some of which can be found
in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/">The TEI Vault</ref>.</p>

        <p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of
<soCalled>Electronic Text Centers</soCalled>, many of whom produced
their own documentation and tutorial materials (some examples are
listed in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials">the TEI Tutorials
pages</ref>). </p>

<p>With the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI
Guidelines, which uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the
Modification mechanism built into the TEI Guidelines, the opportunity
has been taken to produce a lightly revised version of the present
document. This revision documents the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/DTD/teixlite.dtd">XML version of the
TEI Lite DTD</ref>. </p>

    <body>
      <p>This document provides an
introduction to the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI), by describing a manageable subset of the full TEI encoding
scheme. The scheme documented here can be used to encode a wide
variety of commonly encountered textual features, in such a way as to
maximize the usability of electronic transcriptions and to facilitate
their interchange among scholars using different computer systems. It
is also fully compatible with the full TEI scheme, as defined by TEI
document P4, <title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange</title>, published in May 2002, and available from the TEI
    Consortium website at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.
</p>
      <div type="Section" xml:id="U5-Intro">
        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed
        to anyone who wants to interchange information stored in an
        electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual
        information, but other forms of information such as images and
        sound are also addressed. The Guidelines are equally
        applicable in the creation of new resources and in the
        interchange of existing ones.</p>
        <p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain
        features of a text in such a way as to aid the processing of
        that text by computer programs running on different
        machines. This process of making explicit we call
        <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>.  Any textual
        representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI
        came into being partly because of the enormous variety of
        mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting
        scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of
        scholarly uses now being identified for texts in electronic
        form.</p>
        <p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be
        expressed using a number of different formal languages. The
        first editions of the Guidelines used the <term>Standard
        Generalized Markup Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this
        has been replaced by the use of the Extensible Markup Language
        (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of
        text in terms of <term>elements</term> and
        <term>attributes</term>, and rules governing their appearance
        within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its
        complexity and generality, but it is fundamentally no
        different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any
        general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process
        TEI-conformant texts.</p>
        <p>The TEI was sponsored by the Association for Computers and
        the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics,
        and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and
        is now maintained and developed by an independent membership
        consortium, hosted by four major Universities. Funding has
        been provided in part from the U.S. National Endowment for the
        Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the Commission of the
        European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the
        Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The
        Guidelines were first published in May 1994, after six years
        of development involving many hundreds of scholars from
        different academic disciplines worldwide. During the years
        that followed, the Guidelines were increasingly influential in
        the development of the digital library, in the language
        industries, and even in the development of the World Wide Web
        itself. The TEI consortium was set up in January 2001, and a
        year later produced an  edition of the
        Guidelines entirely revised for XML
        compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the
	Guidelines to take full advantage of the new schema
	languages. </p>
        <p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI
        were defined by the closing statement of a planning conference
        held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these
        <soCalled>Poughkeepsie Principles</soCalled> were further
        elaborated in a series of design documents.  The Guidelines,
        say these design documents, should:

<list type="bullets"><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for
       research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose
software;</item><item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of
texts;</item><item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item></list></p>
        <p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines
to have wide acceptability, it was important to ensure that:
<list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove
from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be
possible;</item><item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very
small minimal requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be
provided.</item></list></p>
        <p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the
extensive set of elements and recommendations resulting from
those design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p>
        <p>In selecting from the  several hundred elements defined by
the full TEI scheme, we have tried to identify a useful <soCalled>starter
set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost every user should
know about.  Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in
understanding the full TEI DTD and in knowing which optional parts of
the full DTD are necessary for work with particular types of text.</p>
        <p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows:
<list type="simple"><item>it should include most of the TEI <soCalled>core</soCalled>
tag set, since this contains elements relevant to virtually all text
types and all kinds of text-processing work;</item><!-- deleted this item: there ARE no elements defined in the prose
tagset! --><!-- <ITEM>it should include most of the elements defined in the TEI
base tag set for prose;</ITEM> --><item>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide
variety of texts, at the level of detail found in existing practice
(as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the Oxford Text
Archive);</item><item>it should be useful for the production of new documents as well
as encoding of existing ones;</item><item>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML
software;</item><item>it should be derivable from the full TEI DTD using the
extension mechanisms described in the TEI Guidelines;</item><item>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the
other goals.</item></list> </p>
        <p>The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or
herself. At the time of writing (1995), our confidence that we have at least
partially done so is borne out by its use in practice for the encoding
of real texts.  The Oxford Text Archive uses TEI Lite when it
translates texts from its holdings from their original markup schemes
into SGML; the Electronic Text Centers at the University of Virginia
and the University of Michigan have used TEI Lite to encode their
holdings. And the Text Encoding Initiative itself uses TEI Lite, in
its current technical documentation &#8212; including this document.
       </p>
        <p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as
suits a tutorial text, the reader should be aware that it does not
cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of the elements
described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves,
which should be consulted for authoritative reference information on
these, and on the many others which are not described here.  Some
basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p>

        <head>A Short Example</head>
        <p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when
a passage of prose is typed into a computer by someone with little
sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of electronic texts.
 In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate
optical scanner.  It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the
printed text, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing
blanks to represent the layout of the original headings and page
breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard
are needed (such as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in
<mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash), it attempts to
mimic their appearance.</p>

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly
      things.</eg>

        </p>
        <p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings:
<list type="bullets"><item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the
text in a way which makes it difficult for software to disentangle
them;</item><item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and
apostrophe, so it is difficult to know exactly which passages are in
direct speech;</item><item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that
simple-minded search programs will not find the broken words;</item><item>the accented letter in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> and
the long dash have been rendered by ad hoc keying conventions which
follow no standard pattern and will be processed correctly only if the
transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item><item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space,
and hard carriage returns have been introduced at the end of each
line. Consequently, if the size of type used to print the text
changes, reformatting will be problematic.</item></list></p>
        <p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded using the
TEI Guidelines. As we shall see, there are many ways in which this
encoding could be extended, but as a minimum, the TEI approach allows
us to represent the following distinctions:
<list type="bullets"><item>Paragraph divisions are now marked explicitly.</item><item>Apostrophes are distinguished from quotation marks.</item><item>Entity references are used for the accented letter and the long
dash.</item><item>Page divisions have been marked with an empty <gi>pb</gi>
element alone.</item><item>To simplify searching and processing, the lineation of the
original has not been retained and words broken by typographic
accident at the end of a line have been re-assembled without comment.
If the original lineation were of interest, as it might be for an
important printing, it could easily be recorded, though it has not
been here.</item><item>For convenience of proof reading, a new line has been
introduced at the start of each paragraph, but the indentation is
removed.</item></list>

        <p>The decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the
printing of it in this particular edition, is one aspect of a
fundamental encoding issue: that of selectivity. An encoding makes
explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder.  It
is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this
short passage might readily be extended. For example:
<list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be
provided;</item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be
       added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item><item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the
surrounding text;</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance
and context could be prefixed to it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses,
words, etc., could be provided, each unit being associated with
appropriate category codes;</item><item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse
       units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be
included in the encoding, with potentially complex alignment or
linkage between the text and the analysis, or between the text and one
or more translations of it;</item><item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on
other media.</item></list></p>
        <p>The TEI-recommended way of carrying all of these out is described
in the remainder of this document. The TEI scheme as a whole also
provides for an enormous range of other possibilities, of which we
cite only a few:
<list type="simple"><item>detailed analysis of the components of names;</item><item>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information
about the text's origins or topics;</item><item>information about the printing history or manuscript variations
exhibited by a particular series of versions of the text.</item></list> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the
full Guidelines should be consulted.</p>

      <div type="Section" xml:id="U5-struc">
        <head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head>
        <p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term>
(marked up as a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element) and (b) the transcription
of the text proper (marked up as a <gi>text</gi> element).</p>
        <p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by
the title page of a printed text.  It has up to four parts: a
bibliographic description of the machine-readable text, a description
of the way it has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the
text (a <term>text profile</term>), and a revision history. The
header is described in more detail in section <ptr target="U5-header"/>.</p>
        <p>A TEI text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or
<term>composite</term> (a collection of single works, such as an
anthology). In either case, the text may have an optional <term>front</term>
or <term>back</term>. In between is the <term>body</term> of the
text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of
<term>group</term>s, each containing more groups or texts.</p>
        <p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like
this:
<eg><![CDATA[<TEI.2>
    <teiHeader> [ TEI Header information ]  </teiHeader>
    <text>
        <front> [ front matter ... ]   </front>

        <back>  [ back matter ...  ]   </back>
    </text>
</TEI.2>]]></eg></p>
        <p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between
occur one or more groups of texts, each with its own optional front
and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded using an
overall structure like this:
<eg><![CDATA[<TEI.2>
    <teiHeader> [ header information for the composite ] </teiHeader>
    <text>
        <front> [ front matter for the composite  ]      </front>
        <group>
           <text>
              <front> [ front matter of first text ] </front>
              <body>  [ body of first text  ]          </body>
              <back>  [ back matter of first text ]    </back>
           </text>
           <text>
              <front> [ front matter of second text]  </front>
              <body>  [ body of second text  ]          </body>
              <back>  [ back matter of second text ]    </back>
           </text>
           [ more texts or groups of texts here ]
        </group>
        <back>      [ back matter for the composite  ]      </back>
    </text>
</TEI.2>]]></eg> </p>
        <p>It is also possible to define a composite of TEI texts, each with
its own header. Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>,
and may itself have a header:
<eg><![CDATA[<teiCorpus>
  <teiHeader>   [header information for the corpus]</teiHeader>
  <TEI.2>
     <teiHeader>[header information for first text]</teiHeader>
     <text>     [first text in corpus]             </text>
  </TEI.2>
  <TEI.2>
    <teiHeader>[header information for second text]</teiHeader>
    <text>     [second text in corpus]             </text>
  </TEI.2>
</teiCorpus>]]></eg> It is not however possible to create a composite of corpora --
that is, a number of <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements combined together
and treated as a single object. This is a restriction of the current
version of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
        <p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text
structures. The discussion in each case consists of a short list of
relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief definition of each,
followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to
that element. In most cases, short examples are also given.<!----></p>
      </div>
      <div type="Section" xml:id="U5-body">
        <head>Encoding the Body</head>
        <p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level
consists of the following elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>front</gi></label><item>contains any prefatory matter (headers, title page, prefaces,
dedications, etc.) found before the start of a text proper.</item><label><gi>group</gi></label><item>contains a number of unitary texts or groups of texts.</item><label><gi>body</gi></label><item>contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding any
front or back matter.</item><label><gi>back</gi></label><item>contains any appendixes, etc., following the main part of a
text.</item></list>    Elements specific to front and back matter are described
below in section <ptr target="U5-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss
the elements making up the body of a text. </p>
        <div xml:id="divs" type="div">
          <head>Text Division Elements</head>
          <p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or
these paragraphs may be grouped together into chapters, sections,
subsections, etc. In the former case, each paragraph is tagged using
the <gi>p</gi> tag. In the latter case, the <gi>body</gi> may be
divided either into a series of <gi>div</gi> elements, or into a
series of
<gi>div</gi> elements, either of which may be further subdivided, as
discussed below:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>p</gi></label><item>marks paragraphs in prose.</item><label><gi>div</gi></label><item>contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text.</item><label><gi>div</gi></label><item>contains a first-level subdivision of the front, body, or back
of a text (the largest, if
<gi>div0</gi> is not used, the second largest if it is).</item></list></p>
          <p>When structural subdivisions smaller than a <gi>div</gi> are
necessary, a <gi>div</gi> may be divided into <gi>div</gi>
elements, a <gi>div</gi> into smaller <gi>div</gi> elements, etc.,
down to the level of <gi>div7</gi>.  If more than seven levels of
structural division are present, one must either modify the TEI tag
set to accept
<gi tei="false">div8</gi>, etc., or else use the unnumbered <gi>div</gi>
element:  a <gi>div</gi> may be subdivided by smaller <gi>div</gi>
elements, without limit to the depth of nesting.</p>
          <p>All these <term>division</term> elements take the following three
attributes:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>This indicates the conventional name for this category of text
division.  Its value will typically be <q>Book</q>,
<q>Chapter</q>,
<q>Poem</q>, etc.  Other possible values
include <q>Group</q> for groups of poems,
etc., treated as a single unit, <q>Sonnet</q>,
<q>Speech</q>, and <q>Song</q>.  Note that whatever value is supplied for the <ident>type</ident>
attribute  of the first <gi>div</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, <gi>div</gi>,
etc., in a text is assumed to apply for all subsequent <gi>div</gi>,
<gi>div</gi>s (etc.) within the same <gi>body</gi>. This implies
that a value must be given for the first division element of each
type, or whenever the value changes. </item><label><ident>id</ident></label><item>This specifies a unique identifier for the division, which may
be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a
commentary, as further discussed in section <ptr target="U5-ptrs"/>. It is
often useful to provide an <ident>id</ident> attribute for every
major structural unit in a text, and to derive the ID values in some
systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short
code for the title of the work in question, as in the examples below.</item><label><ident>n</ident></label><item>The <ident>n</ident> attribute specifies a mnemonic short name
or number for the division, which can be used to identify it in
preference to the value given for the <ident>id</ident> attribute.  If a conventional form of reference or
abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the
book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <ident>n</ident>
attribute is the place to record it.</item></list> The attributes <ident>id</ident> and <ident>n</ident>,
indeed, are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in
any TEI DTD:  they are <term>global attributes</term>.  Other global
attributes defined in the TEI Lite scheme are discussed in section
<ptr target="xatts"/>.</p>
          <p>The value of every <ident>id</ident> attribute must be unique
within a document. One simple way of ensuring that this is so is to
make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For example,
Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists
of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some
chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define
<ident>id</ident> values for this structure as follows:

<eg><![CDATA[<div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book">
  <div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter">
   ... </div>
  <div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter">
   ... </div>
   ...
  <div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter">
     <div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part">
      ... </div>
     <div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part">
      ... </div>
  </div>
  ...
 </div>
 <div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book">
   ....
 </div>
...
]]></eg> </p>
          <p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <ident>id</ident> and
<ident>n</ident> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical
reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of
the work.  For example, in a novel divided into books each containing
chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the
whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such
as the following:

<eg><![CDATA[<div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="Volume">
   <div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="Chapter">
      ... </div>
   <div xml:id="TS012" n="2">
      ...</div>
 </div>
 <div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="Volume">
   <div xml:id="TS021" n="3"type="Chapter">
      ...</div>
   <div xml:id="TS022" n="4">
      ...</div>
</div>]]></eg>   Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters.
The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <ident>id</ident>
values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as if they
were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="h25" type="div">
          <head>Headings and Closings</head>
          <p>Every <gi>div</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, etc., may
have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a closing
such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q>.  The
following elements may be used to transcribe them:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>head</gi></label><item>contains any heading, for example, the title of a section, or
the heading of a list or glossary.</item><label><gi>trailer</gi></label><item>contains a closing title or footer appearing at the end of  a
division of a text. </item></list> Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or
ending of text divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="h52"/> .</p>
          <p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a
transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide.
Where a heading is completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>)
or has been given as an attribute value (e.g. <gi>div type="Chapter"
n="1"</gi>), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise
unrecoverable text it should always be included.  For example, the
start of Hardy's <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be
encoded as follows:
<eg><![CDATA[<div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part">
<div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter">
<head>Mellstock-Lane</head>
<p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ...]]></eg></p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="vedr" type="div">
          <head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head>
          <p>As noted above, the paragraphs making up a textual division should
be tagged with the <gi>p</gi> tag. For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<body>
<p>I fully appreciate Gen. Pope's splendid achievements
with their invaluable results; but you must know that
Major Generalships in the Regular Army, are not as
plenty as blackberries.
</p>
</body>]]></eg><!-- Is this quote right? shouldn't it be "plentIFUL"? -->

 --><!--  Library of America, Lincoln, v. 2 p. 315.
 --><!----></p>
          <p>A number of different tags are provided for the encoding of the
structural components of verse and performance texts (drama, film,
etc.):
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>l</gi></label><item>contains a single, possibly incomplete, line of verse.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>part</ident></label><item>specifies whether or not the line is metrically complete. Legal
values are:
<code>F</code> for the final part of an incomplete line,
<code>Y</code> if the line is metrically incomplete,
<code>N</code> if the line is complete, or if no claim is made as to
its completeness,
<code>I</code> for the initial part of an incomplete line,
<code>M</code>  for a medial part of an incomplete line.</item></list></item><label><gi>lg</gi></label><item>contains a group of verse lines functioning as a formal unit
e.g. a stanza, refrain, verse paragraph, etc.</item><label><gi>sp</gi></label><item>contains an individual speech in a performance text, or a
passage  presented as such in a prose or verse text. Attributes
include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>who</ident></label><item>identifies the speaker of the part by supplying an ID.</item></list></item><label><gi>speaker</gi></label><item>contains a special form of heading or label, giving the name of
one or more speakers in a performance text or fragment.</item><label><gi>stage</gi></label><item>contains any kind of stage direction within a performance text
or fragment. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>indicates the kind of stage direction. Suggested values include
 <val>entrance</val>, <val>exit</val>, <val>setting</val>,
<val>delivery</val>, etc.</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse
lines and stanzas are tagged:
<eg><![CDATA[<lg n="I">
<l>I Sing the progresse of a
   deathlesse soule,</l>
<l>Whom Fate, with God made,
  but doth not controule,</l>
<l>Plac'd in most shapes; all times
  before the law</l>
<l>Yoak'd us, and when, and since,
  in this I sing.</l>
<l>And the great world to his aged evening;</l>
<l>From infant morne, through manly noone I draw.</l>
<l>What the gold Chaldee, of silver Persian saw,</l>
<l>Greeke brass, or Roman iron, is in this one;</l>
<l>A worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and stone,</l>
<l>And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,</l>
</lg>]]></eg></p>
          <p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element marks verse lines, not typographic
lines: the original lineation of the first few lines above has not
therefore been made explicit by this encoding, and may be lost. The
<gi>lb</gi> element described in section <ptr target="U5-pln"/> may be
used to mark typographic lines if so desired.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, particularly in dramatic texts, verse lines are split
between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the
<ident>part</ident> attribute to indicate that the lines so
fragmented are incomplete, as in this example:
<eg><![CDATA[<div type ="Act" n="I"><head>ACT I</head>
<div type ="Scene" n="1"><head>SCENE I</head>
<stage rend="italic">
Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at several doors</stage>
<sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="Y">Who's there?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold 
  yourself.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="i">Long live the King!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l part="m">Barnardo?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="f">He.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>You come most carefully upon 
  your hour.</l></sp>]]></eg> </p>
          <p>The same mechanism may be applied to stanzas which are divided
between two speakers:
<eg><![CDATA[<sp><speaker>First voice</speaker>
<lg type="stanza" part="I">
<l>But why drives on that ship so fast</l>
<l>Withouten wave or wind?</l>
</lg>
<sp><speaker>Second Voice</speaker>
<lg part="F">
<l>The air is cut away before.</l>
<l>And closes from behind.</l>
</lg>]]></eg> </p>
          <p>This example shows how dialogue presented in a prose work as if it
were drama should be encoded. It also demonstrates the use of the
<ident>who</ident> attribute to bear a code identifying the speaker
of the piece of dialogue concerned:
<eg><![CDATA[<sp who="OPI"><speaker>The reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>
 <p>I do not think I have named a single unpresentable fish.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="GRM"><speaker>Mr Gryll</speaker>
 <p>Bream, Doctor: there is not much to be said for bream.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="OPI"><speaker>The Reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>
 <p>On the contrary, sir, I think there is much to be said for him.
 In the first place....</p>
<p>Fish, Miss Gryll -- I could discourse to you on fish by
the hour:  but for the present I will forbear.</p>
</sp>]]></eg><!-- Peacock, Gryll Grange, p 778 --></p>

      <div xml:id="U5-pln" type="Section">
        <head>Page and Line Numbers</head>
        <p>Page and line breaks may be marked with the following empty
elements.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>pb</gi></label><item>marks the boundary between one page of a text and the next in a
standard reference system.</item><label><gi>lb</gi></label><item>marks the start of a new (typographic) line in some  edition or
version of a text.</item></list>    These elements mark a single point in the text, not a span
of text. The global <ident>n</ident> attribute should be used to
supply the number of the page or line beginning at the tag. In
addition, these two elements share the following attribute:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>ed</ident></label><item>indicates the edition or version in which the page break is
located at this point.</item></list></p>
        <p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to
record its pagination, if only to simplify later proof-reading.
Recording the line breaks may be useful for the same reason; treatment
of end-of-line hyphenation in printed source texts will require some
consideration.</p>
        <p>If pagination, etc., are marked for more than one edition, specify
the edition in question using the <ident>ed</ident> attribute, and
supply as many tags are necessary. For example, in the following
passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different
editions (<ident>ED1</ident> and <ident>ED2</ident>)
<eg><![CDATA[<p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to
say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus
acted.  Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary approved the
step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would
<pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get over the
honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p>]]></eg></p>
        <p>The <gi>pb</gi> and <gi>lb</gi> elements are special cases of
the general class of <term>milestone</term> elements which mark
reference points within a text.  TEI Lite also includes a generic
<gi>milestone</gi> element, which is not restricted to special cases
but can  mark any kind of reference point:  for example, a column
break, the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, etc.
This element has the following description and attributes:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>milestone</gi></label><item>marks the boundary between sections of a text, as indicated by
changes in a standard reference system. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>ed</ident></label><item>indicates the
	 edition or version to which the milestone
	 applies.</item><label><ident>unit</ident></label><item>indicates what kind of section is changing at this milestone.</item></list></item></list></p>
        <p>The names used for types of unit and for editions referred to by
the <ident>ed</ident> and <ident>unit</ident> attributes may be chosen
freely, but should be documented in the header.</p>
        <p>The <gi>milestone</gi> element may be used to replace the others,

        <div xml:id="faces" type="div">
          <head>Changes of Typeface, etc.</head>
          <p>Highlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from
the rest of the text, typically by a change of type font, handwriting
style, or ink color, intended to draw the reader's attention to
      them.</p>
          <p>The global <ident>rend</ident> attribute can be attached to any
element, and used wherever necessary to specify details of the
highlighting used for it. For example, a heading rendered in bold
might be tagged <code lang="sgml">head rend="bold"</code>, and one in
italic <code lang="sgml">head rend="italic"</code>.</p>
          <p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons
for such changes of rendering in a text.  In such cases, the element
<gi>hi</gi> may be used to mark a sequence of  highlighted text
without making any claim as to its status.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>hi</gi></label><item>marks a word or phrase as graphically distinct from the
surrounding text, for reasons concerning which no claim is
	made.</item></list></p>
          <p>In the following example, the use of a distinct typeface for the
subheading and for the included name are recorded but not interpreted:
<eg><![CDATA[<p><hi rend="gothic">And this Indenture further witnesseth</hi>
that the said <hi rend="italic">Walter Shandy</hi>, merchant,
in consideration of the said intended marriage ...</p>]]></eg></p>
          <p>Alternatively, where the cause for the highlighting can be
identified with confidence, a number of other, more specific, elements
are available.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>emph</gi></label><item>marks words or phrases which are stressed or emphasized for
linguistic or rhetorical effect.</item><label><gi>foreign</gi></label><item>identifies a word or phrase as belonging to some language other
than that of the surrounding text. </item><label><gi>mentioned</gi></label><item>marks words or phrases mentioned, not used.</item><label><gi>term</gi></label><item>contains a single-word, multi-word or symbolic designation
which is regarded as a technical term.</item><label><gi>title</gi></label><item>contains the title of a work, whether article, book, journal,

          <p>Some features (notably quotations and glosses) may be found in a
text either marked by highlighting, or with quotation marks.  In
either case, the elements <gi>q</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi> (as
discussed in the following section) should be used. If the rendition
is to be recorded, use the global <ident>rend</ident> attribute.</p>
          <p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following
sentence:<!-- Theodore M. Andersson, Preface to the Nibelungenlied, p. 3 -->

          <p>Like changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used
to denote several different features within a text, of which the most
frequent is quotation.  When possible, we recommend that the
underlying feature be tagged, rather than the simple fact that
quotation marks appear in the text, using the following elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>q</gi></label><item>contains a quotation or apparent quotation --- a representation
of speech or thought marked as being quoted from someone else (whether

mark real or contrived examples of usage.  Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>may be used to indicate whether the quoted matter is spoken or
thought, or to characterize it more finely. Sample values include:
<val>spoken</val> (for representation of direct speech, usually marked
by quotation marks) and <val>thought</val> (for representation of
thought, e.g. internal monologue).</item><label><ident>who</ident></label><item>identifies the speaker of a piece of direct speech.</item></list></item><label><gi>mentioned</gi></label><item>marks words or phrases mentioned, not used.</item><label><gi>soCalled</gi></label><item>contains a word or phrase for which the author or narrator

          <p>To record how a quotation was printed (for example,
<term>in-line</term> or set off as a <term>display</term> or
<term>block quotation</term>), the <ident>rend</ident> attribute
should be used. This may also be used to indicate the kind of
quotation marks used.</p>
          <p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply
by ending the quotation and beginning it again after the interruption,
as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<p><q>Who-e debel you?</q> &mdash; he at last said &mdash; <q>you
no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q>  And so saying, the lighted
tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</p>]]></eg>If it is important to convey the idea that the two <gi>q</gi>
elements together reproduce a single speech, the linking attributes
<ident>next</ident> and
<ident>prev</ident> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="xatts"/>.</p>
          <p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or
speaker, using the <ident>who</ident> attribute, whether or not the
source is given in the text, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<q who="Wilson">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this
day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he
says:&mdash;<q who="Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that
I was a red-headed man.</q></q>]]></eg><!---->
 This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded
within other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker
(Spaulding).</p>
          <p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation
marks are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the
quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the
text, the <ident>rend</ident> attribute may be used to record the way
in which they were rendered in the copy text.</p>
          <p>As with highlighting, it is not always possible and may not be
considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a
text in this way.  In such cases, the tag <gi>hi rend="quoted"</gi>
might be used to mark quoted text without making any claim as to its
status.<!----></p>

        <div xml:id="z636" type="div">
          <head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head>
          <p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts
may be tagged as such in one of two ways. If the word or phrase is
already tagged for some reason, the element indicated should bear a
value for the global <ident>lang</ident> attribute indicating the
language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element
<gi>foreign</gi> may be used, again using the <ident>lang</ident>
attribute.  For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<p>John has real <foreign lang="fra">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p>]]></eg>
<eg><![CDATA[<p>Have you read <title lang="deu">Die Dreigroschenoper</title>?</p>]]></eg>

<eg><![CDATA[<p>The court issued a writ of <term lang="lat">mandamus</term>.</p>]]></eg></p>
          <p>As these examples show, the <gi>foreign</gi> element should not
be used to tag foreign words if some other more specific element such
as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>mentioned</gi>, or <gi>term</gi> applies.
The global <ident>lang</ident> attribute may be attached to any
element to show that it uses some other language than that of the
surrounding text.</p>

values include <code>inline</code>, <code>interlinear</code>, <code>left</code>,
<code>right</code>, <code>foot</code>,  and <code>end</code>, for
notes which appear as marked paragraphs in the body of the text,
between the lines, in the left or right margin, at the foot of the

the note is not embedded in the text at that point.</item><label><ident>anchored</ident></label><item>indicates whether the copy text shows the exact place of
reference for the note.</item></list></item></list>   
Where possible, the body of a note should be inserted in the
text at the point at which its identifier or mark first appears. This
may not be possible for example with marginalia, which may not be
anchored to an exact location.  For simplicity, it may be adequate to
position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other
element.  Notes may also be placed in a separate division of the text
(as end-notes are, in printed books) and linked to the relevant
portion of the text using their <ident>target</ident> attribute.</p>
        <p>The <ident>n</ident> attribute may be used to supply the number
or identifier of a note if this is required.  The <ident>resp</ident>
attribute should be used consistently to distinguish between authorial
and editorial notes, if the work has both kinds; otherwise, the TEI
header should state which kind they are.</p>

        <head>Cross References and
     Links</head>
        <p>Explicit cross references or links from one point in a text to
another in the same SGML document may be encoded using the elements
described in section <ptr target="ptrs"/>. References or links to
elements of some other SGML document, or to parts of non-SGML
documents, may be encoded using the <term>TEI extended pointers</term>
described in section <ptr target="xptrs"/>. Implicit links (such as
the association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and
its interpretation) may be encoded using the linking attributes
discussed in section <ptr target="xatts"/>.</p>
        <div xml:id="ptrs" type="div">
          <head>Simple Cross References</head>
          <p>A cross reference from one point within a single document to
another can be encoded using either of the following elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>ref</gi></label><item>a reference to another location in the current document, in
terms of one or more identifiable elements, possibly modified by
additional text or comment.</item><label><gi>ptr</gi></label><item>a pointer to another location in the current document in terms
of one or more identifiable elements.</item></list></p>
          <p>These elements share the following attributes:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>target</ident></label><item>specifies the destination of the pointer as one or more SGML
identifiers</item><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>categorizes the pointer in some respect, using any convenient
set of categories.</item><label><ident>targType</ident></label><item>specifies the type (or types)  of element to which this pointer
may point.</item><label><ident>crDate</ident></label><item>specifies when this pointer was made.</item><label><ident>resp</ident></label><item>specifies the creator of the pointer.</item></list></p>
          <p>The difference between these two elements is that <gi>ptr</gi> is
an empty element, simply marking a point from which a link is to be
made, whereas <gi>ref</gi> may contain some text as well &#8212;
typically the text of the cross-reference itself. The <gi>ptr</gi>
element would be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated by
some non-verbal means such as a symbol or icon, or in an electronic
text by a button. It is also useful in document production systems,
where the formatter can generate the correct verbal form of the cross
reference.</p>
          <p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent
(assuming we have documented somewhere the exact verbal form of cross
references represented by <gi>ptr</gi> elements):
<eg><![CDATA[See especially <ref target="SEC12">section 12 on page
       34</ref>.]]></eg><eg><![CDATA[See especially <ptr
       target="SEC12"/>.]]></eg>  The value of the
      <ident>target</ident> attribute must have been used as the 
identifier of some other element within the current document.  This implies that the
passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, and must
therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following
example, the cross reference is to a
<gi>div</gi> element:
<eg><![CDATA[    ...
    see especially <ptr target="SEC12"/>.
    ...
    <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning Identifiers...
    ...]]></eg> </p>
          <p>Because the <ident>id</ident> attribute is global, any element in
a document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a
paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at:
<eg><![CDATA[    ...
    this is discussed in <ref target="pspec">the paragraph on links</ref>
    ...
    <p xml:id="pspec">Links may be made to any kind of element
    ...]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <ident>targType</ident> attribute can be used to specify that
the element pointed to must be of a particular type, as in the
following example:
<eg><![CDATA[    ...
    this is discussed in <ref target="dspec" targType="div div">
    the section on links</ref>]]></eg></p>
          <p>This reference should fail if the element with identifier
<ident>dspec</ident> is neither a <gi>div</gi> nor a <gi>div</gi>.
Note however that this additional check cannot be carried out by an
      SGML or XML parser 
alone, since such parsers can only check that some element
<ident>dspec</ident> exists.</p>
          <p>The <ident>type</ident> attribute can be used to categorize the
link represented by the pointer in any convenient way. The
<ident>resp</ident> and <ident>crDate</ident> attributes may also be
used to represent the person or agency responsible for making the
link, and its date of creation, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[    ...
   this is discussed in
   <ref type="xref" resp="auto" crdate="950521" target="dspec" targType='div div">
   the section on links</ref>]]></eg> These attributes are most likely to be of use in hypertext
systems containing very many pointers used for a variety of purposes
and created by a variety of means.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference  does not correspond
with any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an
element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the
current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an
<gi>anchor</gi> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is
some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <gi>seg</gi> element
may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as
follows:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>anchor</gi></label><item>specifies a location or point within a document so that it may
be pointed to.</item><label><gi>seg</gi></label><item>identifies a span or segment of text within a document so that
it may be pointed to. Attributes include
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>categorizes the segment</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>In the following (imaginary) example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have
been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in
some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in
the second, to a sequence of words:
<eg><![CDATA[  Returning to <ref target="ABCD">the point where I dozed
  off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="EFGH">three
  words</ref> had been circled in red by a previous reader]]></eg></p>
          <p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified
identifiers (<ident>ABCD</ident> and <ident>EFGH</ident> in this
example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document.
Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers,
the <gi>anchor</gi> and
<gi>seg</gi> elements may be used:
<eg><![CDATA[  .... <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> ....
   ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ... </seg> ...]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <ident>type</ident> attribute should be used (as above) to
distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general purpose
elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are  discussed in
section <ptr target="xatts"/> below.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="xptrs" type="div">
          <head>Extended Pointers</head>
          <p>The elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> can only be used for
cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same 
document as their source. They can also refer only to elements
      explicitly tagged in the document.
The elements discussed in this section are not restricted in this way.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>xptr</gi></label><item>defines a pointer to another location in the current document
or an external document.</item><label><gi>xref</gi></label><item>defines a pointer to another location in the current document
or an external document, possibly modified by additional text or
comment.</item></list></p>
          <p>In addition to the pointer attributes already discussed in section
<ptr target="ptrs"/> above, these elements share the following
additional attributes, which are used to specify the target of the
cross reference or link in place of the
<ident>target</ident> attribute:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>doc</ident></label><item>specifies the document within which the required location is to
be found, by default the current document.</item><label><ident>from</ident></label><item>specifies the start of the destination of the pointer as an
expression in the TEI extended pointer syntax, by default the whole of
the document indicated by the <ident>doc</ident> attribute. </item><label><ident>to</ident></label><item>specifies the endpoint of the destination of the pointer as an 
  expression in the TEI extended pointer syntax; may only be specified
if the <ident>from</ident> attribute has been. </item></list></p>
          <p>A full specification of the language used to express the target of
TEI extended pointers is beyond the scope of this document; here we
list here only a few of its more generally useful features. The full
Guidelines should be consulted for more detail.</p>
          <p>An <gi>xptr</gi> (or <gi>xref</gi>) may point to the whole of
some other document simply by supplying an entity name as the value of
the
<ident>doc</ident> attribute, as in this example:
<eg><![CDATA[  see <xref doc="P3">The TEI Guidelines, passim</ref>]]></eg></p>
          <p>This example assumes that some system or public entity with the
name
<ident>P3</ident> has been declared. This declaration has to be
      included within the DTD in force when the document is parsed;
      the manner of doing so is specific to the authoring software in use
(as further discussed in section <ptr target="U5-figs"/>).</p>
          <p>The <ident>from</ident> attribute is used to specify some
location within whatever document is specified by the <ident>doc</ident>
attribute. The specification uses a special language, called the
<term>TEI extended pointer syntax</term>; only some details of which
are given here. In this language, locations are defined as a series of
<term>steps</term>, each one identifying some part of the document,
often in terms of the locations identified by the previous step.  For
example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph
of chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second
paragraph in the second step, and the third sentence in the last step.
A step can be defined in terms of the document tree itself, using such
       concepts  as <val>parent</val>,
<val>descendent</val>, <val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more loosely, in
terms of text patterns, word or character positions. You  can also use
a foreign (non-SGML) notation, or specify a location within a graphic
in terms of its co-ordinate system.</p>
          <p>The <ident>from</ident> and <ident>to</ident> attributes use the
same notation.  Each points to some portion of the target document;
the extended pointer as a whole points to the section beginning at the
start of the <ident>from</ident> and running to the end of the
<ident>to</ident>.</p>
          <p>The first step in a location path will often be to specify the
identifier of some element within the target document, as in this
example:
<eg><![CDATA[<xptr doc="P3" from="id (SA)"/>]]></eg>  This selects the whole of whatever element bears the
identifier
<ident>SA</ident> within the entity <ident>P3</ident>. If a
finer-grained target is required, other steps might follow. The
following keywords are available for you to select other elements in
terms of their relationship to this one:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>child</ident></label><item>elements contained by this one.</item><label><ident>ancestor</ident></label><item>elements which contains this one, directly or indirectly.</item><label><ident>previous</ident></label><item>elements with the same parent as this one but preceding it in
the document.</item><label><ident>next</ident></label><item>elements with the same parent as this one and following it in
the document.</item><label><ident>preceding</ident></label><item>elements in the document which start before this one does,
irrespective of their parents.</item><label><ident>following</ident></label><item>elements in the document which start after this one does,
irrespective of their parents.</item></list></p>
          <p>Each of these keywords implies a particular set of elements (the
set of children, the set of ancestors, the set of previous siblings,
etc.); to specify which element in the set we are pointing at, the
keyword may optionally be followed by a parenthesized list containing:
<list type="simple"><item>a positive or negative number, indicating which of the possibly
many elements found is intended (+1 indicating the first element
encountered, starting from the current location, and -1 indicating the
last), or the keyword <val>all</val>, indicating that all the elements
in the set are to be pointed at;</item><item>a generic identifier, indicating the type of element required,
or a star indicating that any element type will do;</item><item>a set of attribute names and values, indicating that the
element selected should have attributes with the names and values
specified, if any.</item></list></p>
          <p>Continuing the above example, the following reference will select
the third <gi>p</gi> element directly contained by whatever element
has the identifier <ident>SA</ident>:
<eg><![CDATA[<xptr doc="P3" from="id (SA) child (3 p)"/>]]></eg></p>
          <p>Similarly, assuming that the entity <ident>P3</ident> is in fact
a reference to the XML form of the TEI Guidelines, then the following
reference will select section 14.2.2 of that publication in which (as
it happens) the extended pointer syntax is formally defined:
<eg><![CDATA[For full details, see
<ref doc="P3" from="id (SA) child (2 div) child (2 div)">
  TEI Extended pointer syntax definition
</ref>]]></eg></p>
          <p>Normally, the scope  of a cross reference will be adequately
defined by the <ident>from</ident> attribute. For some  documents,
however, it may be more convenient to define both a starting and an
ending scope. As noted above, the <ident>to</ident> attribute is
provided for this purpose. For example,
<eg><![CDATA[  <xptr doc="P1" from="id (xyz)" to="id (abc)"/>]]></eg> is an extended pointer whose target is the sequence starting
at the beginning of whatever element in document <ident>P1</ident>
has identifier <ident>XYZ</ident> and ending at the end of whatever
element in the same document has identifier <ident>ABC</ident>. Any
elements in between are also included, irrespective of structure; the
pointer is erroneous if the end of <ident>ABC</ident> precedes the
start of <ident>XYZ</ident>. </p>
          <p>Very complex specifications are easily built using this syntax.
For example, the following reference will select the most recent <gi>head</gi>
element which carries an attribute <ident>lang</ident> with the value
<val>LAT</val>, and which occurs before the start of the element with
identifier
<ident>SA</ident>:
<eg><![CDATA[<xptr doc="P3" from="id (SA) preceding (1 head lang lat)"/>]]></eg></p>
          <p>If no value is supplied for the <ident>doc</ident> attribute, the
current document is assumed. Thus, the following references are
semantically equivalent. They both indicate the element with
identifier
<ident>X1</ident> within the current document:
<eg><![CDATA[<ptr target="X1"/>
<xptr from="id (X1)"/>]]></eg></p>
          <p>The TEI Extended Pointer Syntax was defined before the more recent
      XLink specifications, which are however to some extent derived
      from them. Work is currently going on to harmonize the two
      specification languages. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="xatts" type="div">
          <head>Linking Attributes</head>
          <p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are
defined for every element in the TEI Lite DTD:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>ana</ident></label><item>links an element with its interpretation.</item><label><ident>corresp</ident></label><item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item><label><ident>next</ident></label><item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item><label><ident>prev</ident></label><item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item></list></p>
          <p>The <ident>ana</ident> (analysis) attribute is intended for use
where a set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined
somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section
<ptr target="U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence
<q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows:
<eg><![CDATA[<seg type="sentence" ana="SVO">
  <seg type="lex" ana="NP1">John</seg>
  <seg type="lex" ana="VVI">loves</seg>
  <seg type="lex" ana="NP1">Nancy</seg>
</seg>]]></eg>  This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the
document of elements with identifiers <ident>SVO</ident>, <ident>NP1</ident>,
and
<ident>VV1</ident> where the significance of these particular codes
is explained. Note the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark
particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the <ident>type</ident>
attribute.</p>
          <p>The <ident>corresp</ident> (corresponding) attribute provides a
simple way of representing some form of correspondence between two
elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be
used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example
<eg><![CDATA[<seg lang="FRA" xml:id="FR1" corresp="EN1">Jean aime Nancy</seg>
<seg lang="ENG" xml:id="EN1" corresp="FR1">John loves Nancy</seg>]]></eg></p>
          <p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the
following example, it has been used to represent anaphoric
correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the show</q>
and <q>Shirley</q>, and between
<q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>:
<eg><![CDATA[<p><title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which made
its Friday night debut only a month ago, was
not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule,
although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="nbc">the network</seg>
says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="shirley">the show</seg>
still is being considered.</p>]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <ident>next</ident> and <ident>prev</ident> attributes
provide a simple way of linking together the components of a
discontinuous  element, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<q xml:id="Q1a" next="Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q>
&mdash he at last said &mdash
<q xml:id="Q1b" prev="Q1a">you no speak-e,

        <p>The process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with

both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or

and (2) the non-standard spellings <mentioned>a'</mentioned> and
<mentioned>feelds</mentioned> for <mentioned>he</mentioned> and

        <p>In addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases,
editors and transcribers may also supply missing material, omit
material, or transcribe material deleted or crossed out in the source.
In addition, some material may be particularly hard to transcribe
because it is hard to make out on the page.  The following elements
may be used to record such phenomena:<list type="gloss"><label><gi>add</gi></label><item>contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.  Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>place</ident></label><item>if the addition is written into the copy text, indicates where
the additional text is written.  Sample values include

<code>top</code>,
<code>bottom</code>, etc.</item></list></item><label><gi>gap</gi></label><item>indicates a point where material has been omitted in a
transcription, whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI
header, as part of sampling practice, or because the material is
illegible or inaudible. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>desc</ident></label><item>gives a description of the omitted text.</item><label><ident>resp</ident></label><item>indicates the editor, transcriber or encoder responsible for
the decision not to provide any transcription of the text and hence
the application of the <gi>gap</gi> tag.</item></list></item><label><gi>del</gi></label><item>contains a letter, word or passage deleted, marked as deleted,
or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by
an author, scribe, annotator or corrector. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>classifies the type of deletion using any convenient typology.</item><label><ident>status</ident></label><item>may be used to indicate faulty deletions, e.g. strikeouts which
include too much or too little text.</item><label><ident>hand</ident></label><item>signifies the hand of the agent which made the deletion.</item></list></item><label><gi>unclear</gi></label><item>contains a word, phrase, or passage which cannot be transcribed
with certainty because it is illegible or inaudible in the source.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>reason</ident></label><item>indicates why the material is hard to transcribe.</item><label><ident>resp</ident></label><item>indicates the individual responsible for the transcription of
the letter, word or passage contained with the
<gi>unclear</gi> element.</item></list></item></list></p>
        <p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by
the transcriber, or (in manuscript material) by the author or scribe.
For example, if the source for an electronic text read
<eg>The following elements are provided for
for simple editorial interventions.</eg> then it might be felt desirable to correct the obvious error,
but at the same time to record the deletion of the superfluous second
<mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus:
<eg><![CDATA[The following elements are provided for
<del hand="LB">for</del> simple editorial interventions.]]></eg> The attribute value <code>LB</code> on the <ident>hand</ident>
attribute indicates that <q>LB</q>
corrected the duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p>
        <p>If the source read<eg>The following elements provided for
for simple editorial interventions.</eg> (i.e. if the verb had been
inadvertently dropped) then the corrected text might read:
<eg><![CDATA[The following elements <add hand="LB">are</add> provided for
<del hand="LB">for</del> simple editorial interventions.]]></eg> The attribute value <code>LB</code> on the <ident>hand</ident>
attribute indicates that <q>LB</q>
corrected the duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p>
        <p>These elements are not limited to changes made by an editor; they
can also be used to record authorial changes in manuscripts.  A
manuscript in which the author has first written <q>How it galls me,
what a galling shadow</q>, then crossed out the word
<mentioned>galls</mentioned> and inserted <mentioned>dogs</mentioned>
might be encoded thus:
<eg><![CDATA[How it <del hand="DHL" type="overstrike">galls</del>

        <p>Similarly, the <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements may be
used together to indicate the omission of illegible material; the

        <head>Names, Dates, Numbers and
     Abbreviations</head>
        <p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of
<soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features which may appear almost
anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of
particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to
objects external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and
places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular problems for many
natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety
of ways in which they may be presented within a text. The elements
described here, by making such features explicit, reduce the
complexity of processing texts containing them.</p>
        <div xml:id="nomen" type="div">
          <head>Names and Referring Strings</head>
          <p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some
person, place, object, etc. Two elements are provided to mark such
strings:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>rs</gi></label><item>contains a general purpose name or referring string. Attributes
include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>indicates more specifically the object referred to by the
referencing string. Values might include <code>person</code>,
<code>place</code>, <code>ship</code>, <code>element</code>, etc.</item></list></item><label><gi>name</gi></label><item>contains a proper noun or noun phrase. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>indicates the type of the object which is being named by the
phrase.</item></list></item></list>    The <ident>type</ident> attribute is used to distinguish
amongst (for example) names of persons, places and organizations,
where this is possible:
<eg><![CDATA[<q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>, </q>
said his lady to him one day, <q>have you heard
that <rs type="place">Netherfield Park</rs> is let
at last?</q>]]></eg><!-- Austen Pride and Prejudice, chap 1 -->
<eg><![CDATA[It being one of the principles of the
<rs type="organization">Circumlocution Office</rs> never,
on any account whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer,
<rs type="person">Mr Barnacle</rs> said, <q>Possibly.</q>]]></eg><!-- Little Dorrit, peng ed, p 153 --></p>
          <p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be
used for any reference to a person, place, etc, not necessarily one in
the form of a proper noun or noun phrase.
<eg><![CDATA[<q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>,</q>
said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him
one day...]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <gi>name</gi> element by contrast is provided for the special
case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may
be used synonymously with the <gi>rs</gi> element, or nested within
it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper
nouns.</p>
          <p>Simply tagging something as a name is generally not enough to
enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms
usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the
text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague.  Moreover, name
prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>,
 may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name,
depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p>
          <p>The following attributes are also available for these and similar
elements to help overcome these difficulties:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>key</ident></label><item>provides an alternative identifier for the object being named,
such as a database record key.</item><label><ident>reg</ident></label><item>gives a normalized or regularized form of the name used.</item></list>   The <ident>key</ident> attribute may be useful as a means
of gathering together all references to the same individual or
location scattered throughout a document:
<eg><![CDATA[  <q>My dear <rs type="person" key="BENM1">Mr. Bennet</rs>,
  </q> said <rs type="person" key="BENM2">his lady</rs>
  to him one day, <q>have you heard that
  <rs type="place" key="NETP1">Netherfield Park</rs>
  is let at last?</q>]]></eg></p>
          <p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the
<ident>reg</ident> (regularization) attribute, which provides a means
of marking the standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated
below:
<eg><![CDATA[  <name type="person" key="WADLM1" reg="de la Mare, Walter">
     Walter de la Mare</name> was born at
  <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in
  <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.]]></eg><!-- Frank Swinnerton, The Georgian Literary Scene, 1938, p. 195 --></p>
          <p>More detailed tagging of the components of proper names is also
possible, using the additional tag set for names and dates.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="div">
          <head>Dates and Times</head>
          <p>Tags for the more detailed encoding of times and dates include the
following:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>date</gi></label><item>contains a date in any format. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>calendar</ident></label><item>indicates the system or calendar to which the date belongs.</item><label><ident>value</ident></label><item>gives the value of the date in some standard form, usually
yyyy-mm-dd.</item></list></item><label><gi>time</gi></label><item>contains a phrase defining a time of day in any format.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>value</ident></label><item>gives the value of the time in a standard form.</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>The <ident>value</ident> attribute specifies a normalized form
for the date or time, using a recognized format such as ISO 8601.
Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>,
<q>September 1990</q>,
<q>twelvish</q>) can usually be expressed
by simply omitting a part of the value supplied; alternatively
imprecise dates or times (for example <q>early
August</q>,
<q>some time after ten and before twelve</q>)
may be expressed as date or time ranges.  If either end of the date or
time range is known to be accurate, (for example, <q>at some time before 1230</q>, <q>a few
days after Hallowe'en</q>) the <ident>exact</ident> attribute may be
used to specify this.</p>
          <p>Examples:<!---->

        </div>
        <div type="div">
          <head>Numbers </head>
          <p>Numbers can be written with either letters or digits (<code>twenty-one</code>,
<code>xxi</code>, and <code>21</code>) and their presentation is
language-dependent (e.g. English <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes
Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English <mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned>
equals French
<mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>). In natural-language processing or
machine-translation applications, it is often helpful to distinguish
them from other, more <soCalled>lexical</soCalled> parts of the text.
In other applications, the ability to record a number's value in
standard notation is important. The <gi>num</gi> element provides
this possibility:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>num</gi></label><item>contains a number, written in any form. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>indicates the type of numeric value. Suggested values include:
<val>fraction</val>,
<val>ordinal</val>  (for ordinal numbers,  e.g. <q>21st</q>),
<val>percentage</val>, and <val>cardinal</val> (an absolute number, e.g.
<q>21</q>, <q>21.5</q>, etc.)</item><label><ident>value</ident></label><item>supplies the value of the number in an application-dependent

          <head>Abbreviations and their Expansion</head>
          <p>Like names, dates, and numbers, abbreviations may be transcribed
as they stand or expanded; they may be left unmarked, or encoded using
the following element:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>abbr</gi></label><item>contains an abbreviation of any sort. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>expan</ident></label><item>gives an expansion of the abbreviation.</item><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>allows the encoder to classify the abbreviation according to
some convenient typology. Sample values include
<mentioned>contraction</mentioned>,
<mentioned>suspension</mentioned>, <mentioned>brevigraph</mentioned>,
<mentioned>superscription</mentioned>, or <mentioned>acronym</mentioned>.
 The <ident>type</ident> attribute may also be given values like
<mentioned>title</mentioned> (for titles of address),
<mentioned>geographic</mentioned>,
<mentioned>organization</mentioned>, etc., describing the nature of
the object referred to.</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing
semi-lexical items such as acronyms or jargon:
<eg><![CDATA[We can sum up the above discussion as follows:  the identity of a

          <p>The <ident>type</ident> attribute may be used to distinguish
types of abbreviation by their function, and the <ident>expan</ident>
attribute may be used to supply an expansion:
<eg><![CDATA[ <name><abbr type="title" expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr>
 <abbr type="initial" expan="Marilyn">M.</abbr>

          <p>This element is also particularly useful where manuscript
materials in which abbreviation is very frequent are being
transcribed.</p>

        <div type="div">
          <head>Addresses</head>
          <p>The <gi>address</gi> element is used to mark a postal address of
any kind. It contains one or more <gi>addrLine</gi> elements, one for
each line of the address.
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>address</ident></label><item>contains a postal or other address, for example of a publisher,
an organization, or an individual.</item><label><ident>addrLine</ident></label><item>contains one line of a postal or other address.</item></list></p>

        <p>The element <gi>list</gi> is used to mark any kind of
<term>list</term>.  A list is a sequence of text items, which may be
ordered, unordered, or a glossary list.  Each item may be preceded by
an item label (in a glossary list, this label is the term being

        <p>Individual list items are tagged with <gi>item</gi>.  The first
<gi>item</gi> may optionally be preceded by a <gi>head</gi>, which
gives a heading for the list.  The numbering of a list may be omitted

        <p>A simple two-column table may be treated as a <term>glossary list</term>,
tagged <gi>list type="gloss"</gi>.  Here, each item comprises a <term>term</term>
and a <term>gloss</term>, marked with <gi>label</gi> and <gi>item</gi>

        <p>It is often useful to distinguish bibliographic citations where
they occur within texts being transcribed for research, if only so
that they will be properly formatted when the text is printed out. The
element <gi>bibl</gi> is provided for this purpose:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>bibl</gi></label><item>contains a loosely-structured bibliographic citation of which
the sub-components may or may not be explicitly tagged. </item></list></p>
        <p>Where the components of a bibliographic reference are to be
distinguished, the following elements may be used as appropriate. It
is generally useful to mark at least those parts (such as the titles
of articles, books, and journals) which will need special formatting. 
The other elements are provided for cases where particular interest
attaches to such details.<!---->

        <p>Tables represent a sizable challenge for any text processing

        <head>Figures and Graphics</head>
        <p>Not all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The
most straightforward text will often contain diagrams or
illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and text are
inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are
complementary. </p>
        <p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the
text, possibly with a brief description of its content, by using the
elements described in this section. The same elements may also be used
to embed digitized versions of the graphic within an electronic
document.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>figure</gi></label><item>marks the spot at which a graphic is to be inserted in a
document. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>entity</ident></label><item>the name of a pre-defined system entity containing a digitized
version of the graphic to be inserted.</item></list></item><label><gi>figDesc</gi></label><item>contains a textual description of the appearance or content of
a graphic, for use when documenting an image without displaying it.</item></list></p>
        <p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a
heading and/or caption, may be included within the <gi>figure</gi>
element itself, in a <gi>head</gi> and one or more <gi>p</gi>
elements, as may also any text appearing within the graphic itself. It
is strongly recommended that a prose description of the image be
supplied, as the content of a <gi>figDesc</gi> element, for the use
of applications which are not able to render the graphic, and to
render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text
is not normally considered part of the document proper.)</p>
        <p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a
graphic, as in this example;
<eg><![CDATA[<pb n="412"/>
<figure></figure>
<pb n="413"/>]]></eg> (Note that the end-tag may not be omitted, even though the
element has no content). More usually, a graphic will have at the
least an identifying title, which should be encoded using the <gi>head</gi>
element. It is also often convenient to include a brief description of
the image, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[  <figure>
    <head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head>
    <figDesc>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading
       a group of revellers.</figDesc>
  </figure>]]></eg></p>
        <p>When a digitized version of the graphic concerned is available, it
is clearly preferable to embed it at the appropriate point within the
document. Graphic elements such as pictures are typically stored in
separate entities (files) from those containing the text of a
document, and using a different notation (storage format). The TEI
Lite DTD supports graphics encoded using the CGM, PNG, TIFF, GIF, or JPEG
standards under the SGML notation names <mentioned>cgm</mentioned>,
<mentioned>png</mentioned>, <mentioned>tiff</mentioned>,
     <mentioned>gif</mentioned>, and <mentioned>jpeg</mentioned> respectively.<note place="foot" >Other
notations may however be used, provided that an appropriate NOTATION
declaration is added to the DTD. </note><!--
assuming MSM agrees with me that we should include Notation declns --><!-- for these within TEI Lite.... --><!-- yep. i do... --></p>
        <p>Whatever format is used to encode the image, it may be embedded
within the document in the same way. The first step is to declare an
entity of a particular type, which specifies a name for the
entity, an external identifier (such as a file name) for it, and the
notation used. For example, assuming that the digitized image of Mr
Fezziwig's ball were held in TIFF format in the file
<ident>fezzi.tff</ident>, an entity declaration like the following
would be necessary:
<eg><![CDATA[<!ENTITY fezziPic SYSTEM "fezzi.tff" NDATA tiff>]]></eg> All such declarations must be processed before the  document
itself; ways of doing this are beyond the scope of the present
     document, but are discussed in the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines2/gentleintro.html">Gentle Introduction to XML</ref> and
     many other introductory texts on SGML and XML.
<!--
 with the TEI Lite DTD this may be accomplished by

whatever file has the public identifier <ident>-//TEI U5-1995//DTD
TEI Lite 1.0 Extensions//EN</ident>.--><!-- need a section/appendix on
putting it all together --></p>
        <p>With the above declaration in force, all that is necessary to
embed the digitized image at the appropriate point in the document is
to supply a value for the <ident>entity</ident> attribute of the <gi>figure</gi>
element:
<eg><![CDATA[  <figure entity="fezziPic">

   <figDesc>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading

        <head>Interpretation and
     Analysis</head>
        <p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of
interpretation or analysis.  While it is certainly difficult, and may
be impossible, to distinguish firmly between
<soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled>
information in any universal way, it remains true that judgments
concerning the latter are typically regarded as more likely to provide
controversy than  those concerning the former.  Many scholars
therefore prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible
to alert the reader that they are considered more open to dispute,
than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of the
elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p>
        <div type="div">
          <head>Orthographic Sentences</head>
          <p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with
no  particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary
to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into
discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label
for use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>.  To
facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest
within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the
following element:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>s</gi></label><item>identifies an <term>s-unit</term> within a document, for
purposes of establishing a simple canonical referencing scheme
covering the entire text. Attributes include
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>categorizes the unit (e.g. as <mentioned>declarative</mentioned>,
<mentioned>interrogative</mentioned>, etc.)</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly
used (in linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic
sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such
as punctuation.  For example, the passage from
<title>Jane Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into
s-units as follows:<eg><![CDATA[<pb n="474"/>
<div type="chapter" n="38">
<p><s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s>
<s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s>
<s n="003">he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s>
<s n="004">When we got back from church, I went
into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner,
and John cleaning the knives, and I said &mdash;</s>
<p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester
this morning.</s></q> ...]]></eg> 
Note that <!-- The end-tags shown above are not strictly necessary, since--> <gi>s</gi>
elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <gi>s</gi> element implies
that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown
above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that
every word in the text being analysed will be contained by exactly one
<gi>s</gi> element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a
unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the
document, then the <ident>id</ident> attribute might be used in
preference to the <ident>n</ident> used in the above
      example.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="div">
          <head>General-Purpose Interpretation
      Elements</head>
          <p>A more general purpose segmentation element, the <gi>seg</gi> has
already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked
targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level portion of text to which the
encoder may assign a user-specified <ident>type</ident>, as well as a
unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for
which there is no provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p>
          <p>For example, the Guidelines provide no <gi tei="false">apostrophe</gi>
element to mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator
addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One approach might be to
regard these as instances of the <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished
from others by an appropriate value for the
<ident>who</ident> attribute. A possibly simpler, and certainly more
general, solution would however be to use the <gi>seg</gi> element as
follows:<eg><![CDATA[<div type="chapter" n="38">
<p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg>
A quiet wedding we had: ...]]></eg> The <ident>type</ident> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element
can take any value, and so can be used to record phrase-level
phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used
and their significance in the header.</p>
          <p>A <gi>seg</gi> element of one type (unlike the <gi>s</gi>
element which it superficially resembles) can be nested within a <gi>seg</gi>
element of the same or another type. This enables quite complex
structures to be represented; some examples were given in section
<ptr target="xatts"/> above. However, because it must respect the
requirement that elements be properly nested, and may not cut
across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement to
associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which
may completely ignore the document hierarchy. It also requires that
the interpretation itself be represented by a single coded value in
the <ident>type</ident> attribute.</p>
          <p>Neither restriction applies to the <gi>interp</gi> element, which
provides powerful features for the encoding of quite complex
interpretive information in a relatively straightforward manner.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>interp</gi></label><item>provides for an interpretive annotation which can be  linked to
a span of text. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>value</ident></label><item>identifies the specific phenomenon being annotated.</item><label><ident>resp</ident></label><item>indicates who is responsible for the interpretation.</item><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>indicates what kind of phenomenon is being noted in the
passage. Sample values include
<code>image</code>,
<code>character</code>,
<code>theme</code>, <code>allusion</code>, or the name of a
particular discourse type whose instances are being identified.</item><label><ident>inst</ident></label><item>points to instances of the analysis or interpretation
represented by the current element.</item></list></item><label><gi>interpGrp</gi></label><item>collects together <gi>interp</gi> tags.</item></list> This elements allows the encoder to specify both the class of
an interpretation, and the particular instance of that class which the
interpretation involves. Thus, whereas with <gi>seg</gi> one can say
simply that something is an apostrophe, with
<gi>interp</gi> one can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a
larger class (rhetorical figures).</p>
          <p>Moreover, <gi>interp</gi>  is an empty element, which must be
linked to the passage to which it applies either by means of the
<ident>ana</ident>  attribute discussed in section <ptr target="xatts"/>
 above, or by means of its own <ident>inst</ident> attribute. This
means that any kind of analysis can be represented, with no need to
respect the document hierarchy, and also facilitates the grouping
of analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose <gi>interpGrp</gi>
element is provided for the latter purpose.</p>
          <p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of
a text as  themes or subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the
locations of individual scenes of the narrative. Different portions of
our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example, might
be associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe, hyperbole,
and metaphor; with subject-matter references to churches, servants,
cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and with scenes located in
the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified location (drawing
room?).</p>
          <p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the <gi>text</gi>
element; it is however good practice to put them all in the same place
(e.g. a separate section of the front or back matter), as in the
following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<back>
<div type="Interpretations">
<p><interp xml:id="fig-apos"  resp="LB, MSM"
     type="figure of speech" value="apostrophe"/>
<interp xml:id="fig-hyp"   resp="LB, MSM"
     type="figure of speech" value="hyperbole"/>
<!-- ... -->
<interp xml:id="set-church"  resp="LB, MSM"
     type="setting" value="church"/>
<!-- ... -->
<interp xml:id="ref-church"  resp="LB, MSM"
     type="reference" value="church"/>
<interp xml:id="ref-serv"    resp="LB, MSM"
     type="reference" value="servants"/>
<!-- ... -->
</p></div>]]></eg><!-- the best place for this list would be in the ANALYSIS
--><!-- element of the header, but meta class elements are only --><!--
allowed within TEXT.  bug, perhaps.  or nwi. --><!-- aye capn definitely looks like a bug to me (lb) --></p>
          <p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably
reduced by using the <gi>interpGrp</gi> element to group together all
those <gi>interp</gi> elements which share common attribute values,
as follows: 
<eg><![CDATA[<back>
<div type="Interpretations">
<p>
<interpGrp type="figure of speech" resp="LB, MSM">
<interp xml:id="fig-apos" value="apostrophe"/>
<interp xml:id="fig-hyp"  value="hyperbole"/>
<interp xml:id="fig-meta" value="metaphor"/>
<!-- ... -->
</interpGrp>
<interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="LB, MSM">
<interp xml:id="set-church"  value="church"/>
<interp xml:id="set-kitch"   value="kitchen"/>
<interp xml:id="set-unspec"  value="unspecified"/>
<!-- ... -->
</interpGrp>
<interpGrp type="reference" resp="LB, MSM">
<interp xml:id="ref-church" value="church"/>
<interp xml:id="ref-serv"   value="servants"/>
<interp xml:id="ref-cook"   value="cooking"/>
<!-- ... -->
</interpGrp>
</p></div>]]></eg></p>
          <p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be
linked with the parts of the text to which they apply in either or
both of two ways. The <ident>ana</ident> attribute can be used on
whichever element is appropriate:
<eg><![CDATA[<div type="chapter" n="38">
<p xml:id="P38.1" ana="set-church set-kitch"></p>
<s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="fig-apos">Reader, I married him.</s>
...]]></eg> Note in this example that since the paragraph has two settings
(in the church  and in the kitchen), the identifiers of both have been
supplied.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the <gi>interp</gi> elements can point to all the
parts of the text to which they apply, using their <ident>inst</ident>
attribute:
<eg><![CDATA[<interp xml:id="fig-apos" type="figure of speech" resp="LB, MSM"
   value="apostrophe" inst="P38.1.1"/>
<!-- ... -->
<interp xml:id="set-church"  type="scene-setting" value="church"
   inst="P38.1" resp="LB, MSM"/>
<interp xml:id="set-kitchen" type="scene-setting" value="kitchen"
   inst="P38.1" resp="LB, MSM"/>
<!-- ... -->]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <gi>interp</gi> is not limited to any particular type of
analysis, The literary analysis shown above is but one possibility;
one could equally well use <gi>interp</gi> to capture a linguistic
part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in
section <ptr target="xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which
might be represented as follows:
<eg><![CDATA[<interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos" value="noun phrase, singular"/>
<interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos" value="inflected verb, present-tense singular"/>

          <p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to
encode a passage from a tutorial introducing the Fortran programming
language:
<eg><![CDATA[<p>It is traditional to introduce a language with a program like the
following:
<eg>
   CHAR*12 GRTG
   GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD'
   PRINT *, GRTG
   END
</eg></p>
<p>This simple example first declares a variable <ident>GRTG</ident>, in
the line <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>, which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident>
as consisting of 12 bytes of type <val>CHAR</val>.  To this variable,
the value <mentioned>HELLO WORLD</mentioned>
is then assigned. This is followed by a <val>PRINT</val> statement and an
<val>END</val> statement.]]></eg></p>
          <p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be
instructed to format examples appropriately (e.g. to preserve line
breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use of tags such
as <gi>ident</gi> and <gi>kw</gi> greatly facilitates the
construction of a useful index.</p>
          <p>The <gi>formula</gi> element should be used to enclose a
mathematical or chemical formula presented within the text as a
distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety of
special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text,
it will usually be necessary to present the body of the formula in a
specialized notation. The notation used should be specified by the
<ident>notation</ident> attribute, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<formula notation="tex">
  \(E = mc^{2}\)
</formula>]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <ident>Tex</ident> notation is not pre-defined for the TEI Lite
DTD; <!-- other notations may be used if desired, but they --> and
   must therefore  be
defined by a <val>notation</val> declaration within the DTD subset.</p>
<!-- <p>Almost any sequence of characters is permitted within the body of
a <gi>formula</gi> element, as far as an SGML-aware processor is
concerned. The data is passed unchanged by the parser to whatever
application has been associated with the notation specified. The only
exception to this rule is that the parser <emph>will</emph> recognize
anything that resembles the start of an SGML end-tag, i.e. the
character less-than (@) followed immediately by a solidus (/) and
an alphabetic character. The following imaginary example would thus
cause a confusing sequence of SGML parser errors:
<eg><![CDATA[<formula notation="tex">
  \(@/E = mc^{2}\)</formula>]]></eg> Fortunately, the sequence <val>@/</val> is
quite unlikely to occur in most mathematical notations in practical
use: if it does occur, special steps must be taken which are beyond
the scope of this document (see the full Guidelines for more
information).</p> -->
<!-- need something on mathml here -->
          <p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the
subject of discussion within a technical document, itself encoded in
XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to distinguish
clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up
the document itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One
      simple solution is to use the predefined entity reference
      <ident>lt</ident> to represent each &lt; character which marks
      the start of an XML tag within the examples. A more
general solution is to mark off the whole body of each example as
containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the
parser. This is achieved by enclosing it within  a special XML
construct called a <term><val>CDATA</val> marked section</term>,  as
in the following example:
<eg>&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as follows:
&lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [
   &lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;First item in the list&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
]]&gt;
&lt;/eg&gt;
The &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;
elements.</eg></p>
          <p>The <gi>list</gi> element used within the example above will not
be regarded as forming part of the document proper, because it is
embedded within a marked section (beginning with the special markup
declaration <val>&lt;![CDATA[ </val>, and ending with
<val>]]&gt;</val>).</p>
          <p>Note also the use of the <gi>gi</gi> element to tag references to
element names (or <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the
body of the text.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="div">
          <head>Generated Divisions</head>
          <p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to
generate automatically whole sections such as a table of contents or
an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to mark the location
at which such a generated section should be placed.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>divGen</gi></label><item>indicates the location at which a textual division generated
automatically by a text-processing application is to appear.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>type</ident></label><item>specifies what type of generated text division (e.g. index,
table of contents, etc.) is to appear. Sample values include:
<code>index</code> (an index is to be generated and inserted at this
point),
<code>toc</code> (a table of contents)
<code>figlist</code> (a list of figures)
<code>tablist</code> (a list of tables).</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>The <gi>divGen</gi> element can be placed anywhere that a
division element would be legal, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<front>
<titlePage> ... </titlePage>
<divGen type="toc"/>
<div type="Preface"><head>Preface</head> ... </div>
</front>
<body> ... </body>
<back>
<div><head>Appendix</head> ... </div>
<divGen type="index" n="Index"/>
</back>]]></eg></p>
          <p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <ident>type</ident>
attribute to distinguish the different kinds of division to be
generated: in the first case a table of contents (a
<mentioned>toc</mentioned>) and in the second an index.</p>
          <p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded
(rather than one being generated) for some reason, the
<gi>list</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="U5-lists"/>
should be used. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="index" type="div">
          <head>Index Generation</head>
          <p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged
document is generally unproblematic for an automatic processor, the
production of a good quality index will often require more careful
tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts
tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all
occurrences of elements such as <gi>term</gi> or <gi>name</gi> will
often be a good departure point for an index. </p>
          <p>The TEI DTD provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag which
may be used to mark both the parts of the document which should be
indexed, and how the indexing should be done.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>index</gi></label><item>marks a location to be indexed for some purpose. Attributes
include:<list type="gloss"><label><ident>level1</ident></label><item>gives the main form of the index entry.</item><label><ident>level2</ident></label><item>gives the second-level form, if any.</item><label><ident>level3</ident></label><item>gives the third-level form, if any.</item><label><ident>level4</ident></label><item>gives the fourth-level form, if any.</item><label><ident>index</ident></label><item>indicates which index (of several) the index entry belongs to.</item></list></item></list></p>
          <p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include
the following:<eg><![CDATA[...
TEI lite also provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag
<index level1="indexing"/>
<index level1="index (tag)" level2="use in index generation"/>
which may be used ...]]></eg></p>
          <p>The <gi>index</gi> element can also be used to provide a form of
interpretive or analytic information.  For example, in a study of
Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's references to
different figures, for comparative stylistic study.  In the following
lines of the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record
the poet's references to Jupiter (as
<mentioned>deus</mentioned>, <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the
subject of <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form
number 227]), to Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as
<mentioned>imago tauri fallacis</mentioned> and the subject of
<mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot" >The
analysis is taken, with permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton
Wright, <title>An Analytical Onomasticon to the Metamorphoses of Ovid</title>
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming).  Some
simplifications have been undertaken.</note>
<eg><![CDATA[<l n="3.001">iamque deus posita fallacis imagine tauri
<l n="3.002">se confessus erat Dictaeaque rura tenebat</l>]]></eg> This need might be met using the <gi>note</gi> element
discussed in section in <ptr target="U5-notes"/>, or with the <gi>interp</gi>
element discussed in section <ptr target="U5-anal"/>. Here we demonstrate
how it might also be satisfied by using the <gi>index</gi> element.</p>
          <p>We assume that the object is to generate more than one index: one
for names of deities (called <ident>dn</ident>), another for
onomastic references (called <ident>on</ident>), <!-- ??? or maybe
not - I haven't the faintest idea myself --> a third for pronominal
references (called <ident>pr</ident>) and so forth. One way of
achieving this might be as follows:
<eg><![CDATA[<l n="3.001">iamque deus posita fallacis imagine tauri
     <index index="dn" level1="Iuppiter" level2="deus"/>
     <index index="on" level1="Iuppiter (taurus)"
                       level2="imago tauri fallacis"/></l>
<l n="3.002">se confessus erat Dictaeaque rura tenebat
     <index index="pr"    level1="Iuppiter" level2="se"/>
     <index index="v"     level1="Iuppiter" level2="confiteor (v227)"/>
     <index index="mons"  level1="Dicte" level2="rura Dictaea"/>
     <index index="regio" level1="Creta" level2="rura Dictaea"/>
     <index index="v"     level1="Iuppiter (taurus)"
                          level2="teneo (v9)"/></l>
]]></eg>  For each <gi>index</gi> element above, an entry will be
generated in the appropriate index, using  as headword the value of
the
<ident>level1</ident> attribute, and as secondary keyword that of the
<ident>level2</ident> attribute, which contains the word cited in
nominative form. The actual reference will be taken from the context
in which the <gi>index</gi> element appears, i.e. in this case the
identifier of the <gi>l</gi> element containing it. </p>

        <head>Character Sets, Diacritics, etc.</head>
        <p>With the advent of XML and its adoption of Unicode as the required
     character set for all documents, most problems previously
     associated with the representation of the divers languages and
     writing systems of the world are greatly reduced. For those
     working with standard forms of the European languages in
     particular, almost no special action is needed: any XML editor
     should enable you to input accented letters or other <soCalled>non-ASCII</soCalled>
     characters directly, and they should be stored in the resulting
     file in a way which is transferable directly between different
     systems, whether as Unicode characters or as character entity references. </p>
        <p>For compatability with other older systems, however, the TEI Lite
     DTD includes declarations for a number of the most widely used
     character entities, so that such characters may be entered and
     saved as character mnemonics. </p>
<!--
the TEI recommendations for character set use are simple.  For local
use, use whatever character set is supported by your machine and your
software.  If your software makes direct keyboard entry of special
characters difficult, you may elect to define your own keyboarding
conventions (for example to represent accented letters by typing the
appropriate accent immediately after the letter, or by using special
sequences unlikely to appear in normal text such as <mentioned>aE</mentioned>
for
<mentioned>ä</mentioned>). Global search and replace functions
can then be used to turn these keyboard shorthands into the proper
characters. If you work with non-Latin scripts and there is a standard
transliteration scheme in your field (e.g. for ancient Greek the beta
code of the Thesaurus Linguæ Græcæ), use it.  Any
transliteration used should be reversible (this rules out a surprising
number of schemes commonly used in normal writing) and will be most
usable if it requires no special ligatures, ties, or diacritics (this
rules out a surprising number of the remainder).</p>
<p>For interchange of files among systems, use SGML entity references
to replace all characters not in the following list of characters
which almost always survive electronic interchange intact:
<eg><![CDATA[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
" % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? _   (space)]]></eg>This list excludes the following characters which, to the
frequent annoyance of unsuspecting users, often do not survive
transfer across national boundaries or over standard wide-area
networks.  If you're just going from your Mac to your PC, though,
these characters will probably be safe:
<eg><![CDATA[! # $ [ \ ] ^ ` { } | ~]]></eg></p>
<p>To ensure proper transmission across multi-vendor networks, entity
references must be used for all accented and extended-Latin
characters, all non-Latin characters, and all symbols not on
conventional computer keyboards.</p> -->
        <p>You may use your own entity names in TEI-conformant files, if
you wish and if you provide entity declarations for
them, mapping the name to the appropriate Unicode value. The standard names (though long-winded) have the advantage
of clarity; the characters intended are reasonably clear to any
speaker of English who recognizes that a character is being named,
often even without recourse to any list.  This is not true of many
older schemes for representing accented characters.</p>
<!--<p>The entity names needed for the characters listed above as
<soCalled>unsafe</soCalled> and for the accented characters of some
major Western European languages are given below. Lists of public
entity sets and their contents are available in any reference work on
SGML:  the names given below are from ISO public entity sets, are
widely used, and are therefore recommended.</p>-->
        <p>When the character you need does not appear in the public entity
sets, you may wish to generate a name using the same naming
conventions used in ISO public entity sets, as described here:<list type="gloss"><label>digraphs</label><item>Form entity names for digraphs by appending the string

       Declarations</head>
            <p>The <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element is used to provide detailed
information about the SGML tags actually appearing within a text. It
may contain a simple list of elements used, with a count for each,
using the following special purpose elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>tagUsage</gi></label><item>supplies information about the usage of a specific element
within the outermost <gi>text</gi> of a TEI conformant document.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>gi</ident></label><item>the name (generic identifier) of the element indicated by the
tag.</item><label><ident>occurs</ident></label><item>specifies the number of occurrences of this element within the
text.</item></list></item></list></p>
            <p>The <gi>rendition</gi> element is used to document different ways
in which elements are rendered in the source text.
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>rendition</gi></label><item>supplies information about the intended rendition of one or
more elements.</item><label><gi>tagUsage</gi></label><item>supplies information about the usage of a specific element
within a <gi>text</gi>. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident>occurs</ident></label><item>specifies the number of occurrences of this element within the
text.</item><label><ident>ident</ident></label><item>specifies the number of occurrences of this element within the
text which bear a distinct value for the global
<ident>id</ident> attribute.</item><label><ident>render</ident></label><item>specifies the identifier of a <gi>rendition</gi> element which
defines how this element is to be rendered.</item></list></item></list></p>
            <p>For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<tagsDecl>
 <tagUsage gi="text" occurs=1>
 <tagUsage gi="body" occurs=1>
 <tagUsage gi=p occurs="12">
 <tagUsage gi="hi" occurs=6>
</tagsDecl>]]></eg>  This (imaginary) tags declaration would be appropriate for a
text containing twelve paragraphs in its body, within which six <gi>hi</gi>
elements have been marked. Note that if the <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element
is used, it must contain a <gi>tagUsage</gi> element for <emph>every</emph>
element tagged in the associated text element.</p>
            <p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is used to document the way in
which any standard referencing scheme built into the encoding works.
In its simplest form, it consists of prose description.</p>
            <p>Example:
<eg><![CDATA[<refsDecl>
     <p>The N attribute on each DIV and DIV contains the
     canonical reference for each such division in the form
     XX.yyy where XX is the book number in roman numeral and
     yyy is the section number in arabic.
</refsDecl>]]></eg></p>
            <p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element groups together definitions or
sources for any descriptive classification schemes used by other parts
of the header. At least one such scheme must be provided, encoded
using the following elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>taxonomy</gi></label><item>defines a typology used to classify texts either implicitly, by
means of a bibliographic citation, or explicitly by a structured
taxonomy.</item><label><gi>bibl</gi></label><item>contains a loosely-structured bibliographic citation of which
the sub-components may or may not be explicitly tagged. </item><label><gi>category</gi></label><item>contains an individual descriptive category, possibly nested
within a superordinate category, within a user-defined taxonomy.</item><label><gi>catDesc</gi></label><item>describes some category within a taxonomy or text typology, in
the form of a brief prose description.</item></list>   In the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a
bibliographic reference, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<classDecl>
     <taxonomy xml:id="LCSH">
          <bibl>Library of Congress Subject Headings
          </bibl>
     </taxonomy>
</classDecl>]]></eg></p>
            <p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special
purpose classification scheme, as in the following example:
<eg><![CDATA[<taxonomy xml:id=B>
   <bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl>
   <category xml:id="B.A"><catDesc>Press Reportage
      <category xml:id="B.A1"><catDesc>Daily</category>

      <category xml:id="B.D2"><catDesc>Periodicals and tracts</category>
   </category>
  ...
</taxonomy>]]></eg></p>
            <p>Linkage between a particular text and a category within such a
taxonomy is made by means of the <gi>catRef</gi> element within the
<gi>textClass</gi> element, as further described
       below.</p>

          <head>The Profile Description</head>
          <p>The <gi>profileDesc</gi> element enables information

<list type="gloss"><label><gi>creation</gi></label><item>contains information about the creation of a text.</item><label><gi>langUsage</gi></label><item>describes the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects,
