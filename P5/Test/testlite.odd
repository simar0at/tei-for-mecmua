        <head>Prefatory note</head>
        <p>TEI Lite was the name adopted for what the TEI editors originally
conceived of as a simple demonstration of how the TEI encoding scheme
might be adopted to meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user
community. In retrospect, it was predictable that many people should
imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far
too heavy for their needs.<!-- (to meet the latter criticism, Michael also
prepared a special <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Bare">barebones version of TEI
Lite</ref>).--></p>
        <p>The original TEI Lite was based largely on  observations of existing and
previous practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest
in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford
Text Archive</ref> and in our own experience. It is therefore
unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a de facto standard,
at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and
encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced
this shortish, readable, manual for it also helped.</p>
<!-- <p>That manual was, of course, authored and is maintained in the DTD
it describes, originally as <ref target="#teiu5_en.xml">an XML
document</ref>. This makes it easy to produce a number of differently
formatted versions in HTML, PDF, etc., some of which can be found
in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/">The TEI Vault</ref>.</p>
-->
        <p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of
        <soCalled>Electronic Text Centers</soCalled>, many of whom
        produced their own documentation and tutorial materials (some
        examples are listed in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials">the TEI Tutorials
        pages</ref>). It was also widely adopted as the basis for
        TEI-conformant authoring systems. Documentation introducing
        TEI Lite has been widely used for tutorial purposes and has
        been widely translated (see further the list of versions at
        <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/"/>).</p>
        <p>With the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI
Guidelines, which uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the
modification mechanism built into the TEI Guidelines, the opportunity
was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version, but the
present revision is the first substantively changed version since its
first appearance in 1997. This revision takes advantage of the many
new features introduced into the TEI Guidelines at release P5. A brief
list of those changes likely to affect users of previous versions of
this document is given below (<ptr target="#changes"/>). </p>

    <body>
      <p>This document provides an
introduction to the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI), by describing a specific subset of the full TEI encoding
scheme. The scheme documented here can be used to encode a wide
variety of commonly encountered textual features, in such a way as to
maximize the usability of electronic transcriptions and to facilitate
their interchange among scholars using different computer systems. It
is fully compatible with the full TEI scheme, as defined by TEI
document P5, <title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange</title>, as of February 2006, and available from the TEI
    Consortium website at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.
</p>
      <div type="Section" xml:id="U5-Intro">
        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed
        to anyone who wants to interchange information stored in an
        electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual
        information, but other forms of information such as images and
        sound are also addressed. The Guidelines are equally
        applicable in the creation of new resources and in the
        interchange of existing ones.</p>
        <p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain
        features of a text in such a way as to aid the processing of
        that text by computer programs running on different
        machines. This process of making explicit we call
        <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>.  Any textual
        representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI
        came into being partly because of the enormous variety of
        mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting
        scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of
        scholarly uses now being identified for texts in electronic
        form.</p>
        <p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be
        expressed using a number of different formal languages. The
        first editions of the Guidelines used the <term>Standard
        Generalized Markup Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this
        has been replaced by the use of the Extensible Markup Language
        (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of
        text in terms of <term>elements</term> and
        <term>attributes</term>, and rules governing their appearance
        within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its
        complexity and generality, but it is fundamentally no
        different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any
        general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process
        TEI-conformant texts.</p>
        <p>The TEI was sponsored by the Association for Computers and
        the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics,
        and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and
        is now maintained and developed by an independent membership
        consortium, hosted by four major Universities. Funding has
        been provided in part from the U.S. National Endowment for the
        Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the Commission of the
        European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the
        Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The
        Guidelines were first published in May 1994, after six years
        of development involving many hundreds of scholars from
        different academic disciplines worldwide. During the years
        that followed, the Guidelines were increasingly influential in
        the development of the digital library, in the language
        industries, and even in the development of the World Wide Web
        itself. The TEI consortium was set up in January 2001, and a
        year later produced an  edition of the
        Guidelines entirely revised for XML
        compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the
	Guidelines to take full advantage of new schema
	languages, the first release of which appeared in 2005. This
	revision of the TEI Lite manual conforms to version 0.3 of
	this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5.</p>
        <p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI
        were defined by the closing statement of a planning conference
        held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these
        <soCalled>Poughkeepsie Principles</soCalled> were further
        elaborated in a series of design documents.  The Guidelines,
        say these design documents, should:

<list type="bullets"><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for
       research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose
software;</item><item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of
texts;</item><item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item></list></p>
        <p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines
to have wide acceptability, it was important to ensure that:
<list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove
from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be
possible;</item><item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very
small minimal requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be
provided.</item></list></p>
        <p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the
extensive set of elements and recommendations resulting from those
design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p>
        <p>In selecting from the  several hundred elements defined by
the full TEI scheme, we have tried to identify a useful <soCalled>starter
set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost every user should
know about.  Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in
understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate
specialized parts of it into the general TEI framework.</p>
        <p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows:
<list type="simple"><item>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide variety
of texts, at the level of detail found in existing practice (as
demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the Oxford Text
Archive);</item><item>it should be useful for the production of new documents (such as
this one) as well as the encoding of existing texts;</item><item>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML
software;</item><item>it should be derivable from the full TEI scheme using the
extension mechanisms described in the TEI Guidelines;</item><item>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the
other goals.</item></list> </p>
        <p>The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or
herself. At the time of first writing (1995), our confidence that we
have at least partially done so is borne out by its use in practice
for the encoding of real texts.  The Oxford Text Archive uses TEI Lite
when it translates texts from its holdings from their original markup
schemes into SGML; the Electronic Text Centers at the University of
Virginia and the University of Michigan have used TEI Lite to encode
their holdings. And the Text Encoding Initiative itself uses TEI Lite,
in its current technical documentation — including this
document.
       </p>
        <p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as
suits a tutorial text, the reader should be aware that it does not
cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of the elements
described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves,
which should be consulted for authoritative reference information on
these, and on the many others which are not described here.  Some
basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p>

        <head>A Short Example</head>
        <p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when
a passage of prose is typed into a computer by someone with little
sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of electronic texts.
In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate
optical scanner.  It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the
printed text, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing
blanks to represent the layout of the original headings and page
breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard
are needed (such as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in
<mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash), it attempts to
mimic their appearance.</p>

          <eg>                          CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly
things.</eg>
        </p>
        <p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings:
<list type="bullets"><item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the
text in a way which makes it difficult for software to disentangle
them;</item><item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and
apostrophe, so it is difficult to know exactly which passages are in
direct speech;</item><item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that
simple-minded search programs will not find the broken words;</item><item>the accented letter in <mentioned>fa&#xE0;l</mentioned> and
the long dash have been rendered by ad hoc keying conventions which
follow no standard pattern and will be processed correctly only if the
transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item><item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space,
and hard carriage returns have been introduced at the end of each
line. Consequently, if the size of type used to print the text
changes, reformatting will be problematic.</item></list></p>
        <p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded using the
TEI Guidelines. As we shall see, there are many ways in which this
encoding could be extended, but as a minimum, the TEI approach allows
us to represent the following distinctions:
<list type="bullets"><item>Paragraph and chapter divisions are now marked explicitly.</item><item>Apostrophes are distinguished from quotation marks; direct
speech is explicitly marked.</item><item>The accented letter and the long dash are correctly represented.</item><item>Page divisions have been marked with an empty <gi>pb</gi>
element alone.</item><item>The lineation of the
original has not been retained and words broken by typographic
accident at the end of a line have been re-assembled without comment.</item><item>For convenience of proof reading, a new line has been
introduced at the start of each paragraph, but the indentation is
removed.</item></list>

        <p>This particular encoding represents a set of choices or priorities.
The decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the
printing of it in this particular edition, is an instance of the
fundamental <emph>selectivity</emph> of any encoding. An encoding makes
explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder.  It
is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this
short passage might readily be extended. For example:
<list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be
provided;</item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be
added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be
added;</item><item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the
surrounding text;</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance
and context could be prefixed to it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses,
words, etc., could be provided, each unit being associated with
appropriate category codes;</item><item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse
       units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be
included in the encoding, with potentially complex alignment or
linkage between the text and the analysis, or between the text and one
or more translations of it;</item><item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on
other media.</item></list></p>
        <p>A TEI-recommended way of carrying out most of these is described
in the remainder of this document. The TEI scheme as a whole also
provides for an enormous range of other possibilities, of which we
cite only a few:
<list type="simple"><item>detailed analysis of the components of names;</item><item>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information
about the text's origins or topics;</item><item>information about the printing history or manuscript variations
exhibited by a particular series of versions of the text.</item></list> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the
full Guidelines should be consulted.</p>

        <head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head>
        <p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term>
(marked up as a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element) and (b) the transcription
of the text proper (marked up as a <gi>text</gi> element). These two
elements are combined together to form a single <gi>TEI</gi> element. 
</p>
        <p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by
the title page of a printed text.  It has up to four parts: a
bibliographic description of the machine-readable text, a description
of the way it has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the
text (a <term>text profile</term>), and a revision history. The
header is described in more detail in section <ptr target="#U5-header"/>.</p>
        <p>A TEI text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or
<term>composite</term> (a collection of single works, such as an
anthology). In either case, the text may have an optional <term>front</term>
or <term>back</term>. In between is the <term>body</term> of the
text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of
<term>group</term>s, each containing more groups or texts.</p>

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader> [ TEI Header information ]  </teiHeader><text><front> [ front matter ... ]   </front><body>  [ body of text ... ]   </body><back>  [ back matter ...  ]   </back></text></TEI></egXML></p>
        <p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between
occur one or more groups of texts, each with its own optional front
and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded using an
overall structure like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader> [ header information for the composite ] </teiHeader><text><front> [ front matter for the composite  ]      </front><group><text><front> [ front matter of first text ] </front><body>  [ body of first text  ]          </body><back>  [ back matter of first text ]    </back></text><text><front> [ front matter of second text]  </front><body>  [ body of second text  ]          </body><back>  [ back matter of second text ]    </back></text>
           [ more texts or groups of texts here ]
        </group><back>      [ back matter for the composite  ]      </back></text></TEI></egXML></p>
        <p>It is also possible to define a composite of TEI texts, each with
its own header. Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>,
and may itself have a header:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiCorpus><teiHeader>   [header information for the corpus]</teiHeader><TEI><teiHeader>[header information for first text]</teiHeader><text>     [first text in corpus]             </text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>[header information for second text]</teiHeader><text>     [second text in corpus]             </text></TEI></teiCorpus></egXML>
It is not however possible to create a composite of corpora --
that is, a number of <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements combined together
and treated as a single object. This is a restriction of the current
version of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
        <p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text
structures. The discussion in each case consists of a short list of
relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief definition of each,
followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to
that element, and a reference to any <term>classes</term> of which the
element is a member. These references are linked to full
specifications for each object, as given in the TEI
<title>Guidelines</title>. In most cases, short examples are also given.<!----></p>
        <p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far:
<specList><specDesc key="TEI"/><specDesc key="teiHeader"/><specDesc key="text"/></specList></p>
      </div>
      <div type="Section" xml:id="U5-body">
        <head>Encoding the Body</head>
        <p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level
consists of the following elements:

<specList><specDesc key="front"/><specDesc key="group"/><specDesc key="body"/><specDesc key="back"/></specList>


Elements specific to front and back matter are described
below in section <ptr target="#U5-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss
the elements making up the body of a text. </p>
        <div xml:id="divs" type="div">
          <head>Text Division Elements</head>
          <p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or
these paragraphs may be grouped together into chapters, sections,
subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using
the <gi>p</gi> tag. The <gi>div</gi> element is used to represent any
such grouping of paragraphs. 
<specList><specDesc key="p"/><specDesc key="div"/></specList>
  </p>
          <p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi> element may be
used to supply a conventional name for this category of text division,
or otherwise distinguish them.  Typical values might be <q>book</q>,
<q>chapter</q>, <q>section</q>, <q>part</q>, <q>poem</q>, <q>song</q>,
etc.  For a given project, it will usually be advisable to define and
adhere to a specific list of such values.  </p>
          <p>A <gi>div</gi> element may itself contain further, nested,
<gi>div</gi>s, thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book,
which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as parts,
containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general
conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p>
          <p> The <att>xml:id</att> attribute may be used to supply a unique
identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references or
other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in
section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>. It is often useful to provide an
<att>xml:id</att> attribute for every major structural unit in a
text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example
by appending a section number to a short code for the title of the
work in question, as in the examples below.</p>
          <p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or
alternatively) a short mnemonic name
or number for the division.  If a conventional form of reference or
abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the
book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <att>n</att>
attribute is the place to record it.</p>
          <p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be used to specify the
language of the division.  Languages are identified by an
internationally defined code, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p>
          <p>The <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to supply information
about the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element,
as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-hilites"/> below. As with the
<att>type</att> attribute, a project will often find it useful to
predefine the possible values for this attribute, but TEI Lite does
not constrain it in anyway. </p>
          <p> These four attributes, <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>,
<att>xml:lang</att>, and <att>rend</att> are so widely useful that
they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema: they are
<term>global attributes</term>.  Other global attributes defined in
the TEI Lite scheme are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
          <p>The value of every <att>xml:id</att> attribute should be unique
within a document. One simple way of ensuring that this is so is to
make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For example,
Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists
of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some
chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define
<att>xml:id</att> values for this structure as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter">
   ... </div><div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter">
   ... </div>
   ...
  <div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part">
      ... </div><div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part">
      ... </div></div>
  ...
 </div><div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book">
   ....
</div></body></egXML></p>
          <p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <att>xml:id</att> and
<att>n</att> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical
reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of
the work.  For example, in a novel divided into books each containing
chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the
whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such
as the following:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="Volume"><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="Chapter">
      ... </div><div xml:id="TS012" n="2">
      ...</div></div><div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="Volume"><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="Chapter">
      ...</div><div xml:id="TS022" n="4">
      ...</div></div></body></egXML>
Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters.
The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <att>xml:id</att>
values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as if they
were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="h25">
          <head>Headings and Closings</head>
          <p>Every <gi>div</gi>  may
have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a closing
such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q>.  The
following elements may be used to transcribe them:

<specList><specDesc key="head"/><specDesc key="trailer"/></specList>

Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or ending
of text divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p>
          <p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a
transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide.
Where a heading is completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>)
or may be automatically constructed from attribute values
(e.g. <gi>div type="Chapter" n="1"</gi>), it may be omitted; where it
contains otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included.
For example, the start of Hardy's <title>Under the Greenwood
Tree</title> might be encoded as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part"><div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter"><head>Mellstock-Lane</head><p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... 
</p></div></div></egXML></p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="vedr">
          <head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head>
          <p>As noted above, the paragraphs making up a textual division should
be tagged with the <gi>p</gi> tag. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I fully appreciate Gen. Pope's splendid achievements
with their invaluable results; but you must know that
Major Generalships in the Regular Army, are not as
plenty as blackberries.
</p></egXML>
<!-- Is this quote right? shouldn't it be "plentIFUL"? -->
 <!-- A. Lincoln to Richard Yates and William Butler, 10 Apr 1862,
 --><!--  Library of America, Lincoln, v. 2 p. 315.
 --><!----></p>
          <p>A number of different tags are provided for the encoding of the
structural components of verse and performance texts (drama, film,
etc.):
<specList><specDesc key="l"/><specDesc key="lg"/><specDesc key="sp"/><specDesc key="speaker"/><specDesc key="stage"/></specList>

<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>l</gi></label><item>contains a single, possibly incomplete, line of verse.
Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>part</att></label><item>specifies whether or not the line is metrically complete. Legal
values are:
<code>F</code> for the final part of an incomplete line,
<code>Y</code> if the line is metrically incomplete,
<code>N</code> if the line is complete, or if no claim is made as to
its completeness,
<code>I</code> for the initial part of an incomplete line,
<code>M</code>  for a medial part of an incomplete line.</item></list></item><label><gi>lg</gi></label><item>contains a group of verse lines functioning as a formal unit
e.g. a stanza, refrain, verse paragraph, etc.</item><label><gi>sp</gi></label><item>contains an individual speech in a performance text, or a
passage  presented as such in a prose or verse text. Attributes
include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>who</att></label><item>identifies the speaker of the part by supplying an ID.</item></list></item><label><gi>speaker</gi></label><item>contains a special form of heading or label, giving the name of
one or more speakers in a performance text or fragment.</item><label><gi>stage</gi></label><item>contains any kind of stage direction within a performance text
or fragment. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>type</att></label><item>indicates the kind of stage direction. Suggested values include
 <val>entrance</val>, <val>exit</val>, <val>setting</val>,
<val>delivery</val>, etc.</item></list></item></list>-->
</p>
          <p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse
lines and stanzas are tagged:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg n="I"><l>I Sing the progresse of a
   deathlesse soule,</l><l>Whom Fate, with God made,
  but doth not controule,</l><l>Plac'd in most shapes; all times
  before the law</l><l>Yoak'd us, and when, and since,
  in this I sing.</l><l>And the great world to his aged evening;</l><l>From infant morne, through manly noone I draw.</l><l>What the gold Chaldee, of silver Persian saw,</l><l>Greeke brass, or Roman iron, is in this one;</l><l>A worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and stone,</l><l>And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,</l></lg></egXML></p>
          <p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element marks verse lines, not typographic
lines: the original lineation of the first few lines above has not
therefore been made explicit by this encoding, and may be lost. The
<gi>lb</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#U5-pln"/> may be
used to mark typographic lines if so desired.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, particularly in dramatic texts, verse lines are split
between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the
<att>part</att> attribute to indicate that the lines so
fragmented are incomplete, as in this example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="Act" n="I"><head>ACT I</head><div type="Scene" n="1"><head>SCENE I</head><stage rend="italic">
Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at several doors</stage><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="Y">Who's there?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold 
  yourself.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="I">Long live the King!</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l part="M">Barnardo?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="F">He.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>You come most carefully upon 
  your hour.</l></sp>... </div></div></egXML></p>
          <p>The same mechanism may be applied to stanzas which are divided
between two speakers:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div><sp><speaker>First voice</speaker><lg type="stanza" part="I"><l>But why drives on that ship so fast</l><l>Withouten wave or wind?</l></lg></sp><sp><speaker>Second Voice</speaker><lg part="F"><l>The air is cut away before.</l><l>And closes from behind.</l></lg></sp>... </div></egXML> </p>
          <p>This example shows how dialogue presented in a prose work as if it
were drama should be encoded. It also demonstrates the use of the
<att>who</att> attribute to bear a code identifying the speaker
of the piece of dialogue concerned:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div><sp who="OPI"><speaker>The reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker><p>I do not think I have named a single unpresentable fish.</p></sp><sp who="GRM"><speaker>Mr Gryll</speaker><p>Bream, Doctor: there is not much to be said for bream.</p></sp><sp who="OPI"><speaker>The Reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker><p>On the contrary, sir, I think there is much to be said for him.
 In the first place....</p><p>Fish, Miss Gryll -- I could discourse to you on fish by
the hour:  but for the present I will forbear.</p></sp></div></egXML><!-- Peacock, Gryll Grange, p 778 --></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="U5-pln">
        <head>Page and Line Numbers</head>
        <p>Page and line breaks may be marked with the following empty
elements.
<specList><specDesc key="pb"/><specDesc key="lb"/><specDesc key="milestone"/></specList>
<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>pb</gi></label><item>marks the boundary between one page of a text and the next in a
standard reference system.</item><label><gi>lb</gi></label><item>marks the start of a new (typographic) line in some  edition or
version of a text.</item></list> -->
These elements mark a single point in the text, not a span
of text. The global <att>n</att> attribute should be used to
supply the number of the page or line beginning at the tag. 
<!-- In
addition, these two elements share the following attribute:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>ed</att></label><item>indicates the edition or version in which the page break is
located at this point.</item></list>--></p>
        <p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to
record its pagination, if only to simplify later proof-reading.
Recording the line breaks may be useful for the same reason; treatment
of end-of-line hyphenation in printed source texts will require some
consideration.</p>
        <p>If pagination, etc., are marked for more than one edition, specify
the edition in question using the <att>ed</att> attribute, and
supply as many tags are necessary. For example, in the following
passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different
editions (<val>ED1</val> and <val>ED2</val>)
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to
say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus
acted.  Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary approved the
step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would
<pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get over the
honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p></egXML></p>
        <p>The <gi>pb</gi> and <gi>lb</gi> elements are special cases of
the general class of <term>milestone</term> elements which mark
reference points within a text.  TEI Lite also includes a generic
<gi>milestone</gi> element, which is not restricted to special cases
but can  mark any kind of reference point:  for example, a column
break, the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, or in
general any significant change in the text not marked by an
XML element.
<!--
This element has the following description and attributes:

<list type="gloss"><label><gi>milestone</gi></label><item>marks the boundary between sections of a text, as indicated by
changes in a standard reference system. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>ed</att></label><item>indicates the
	 edition or version to which the milestone
	 applies.</item><label><att>unit</att></label><item>indicates what kind of section is changing at this milestone.</item></list></item></list></p>-->

The names used for types of unit and for editions referred to by the
<att>ed</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes may be chosen freely, but
should be documented in the header. The <gi>milestone</gi> element may
be used to replace the others, or the others may be used as a set;
they should not be mixed arbitrarily.</p>

          <p>Highlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from
the rest of the text, typically by a change of type font, handwriting
style, ink colour etc., which is intended to draw the reader's attention to
some associated change.</p>
          <p>The global <att>rend</att> attribute can be attached to any
element, and used wherever necessary to specify details of the
highlighting used for it. For example, a heading rendered in bold
might be tagged <gi>head rend="bold"</gi>, and one in
italic <gi>head rend="italic"</gi>.</p>
          <p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons
for such changes of rendering in a text.  In such cases, the element
<gi>hi</gi> may be used to mark a sequence of  highlighted text
without making any claim as to its status.
<specList><specDesc key="hi"/></specList></p>

          <p>Some features (notably quotations and glosses) may be found in a

either case, the elements <gi>q</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi> (as
discussed in the following section) should be used. If the rendition
is to be recorded, use the global <att>rend</att> attribute.</p>
          <p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following
sentence:<!-- Theodore M. Andersson, Preface to the Nibelungenlied, p. 3 -->
<q rend="display">On the one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title>

the <hi rend="ital">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the romances of Chrétien

to denote several different features within a text, of which the most
frequent is quotation.  When possible, we recommend that the
underlying feature be tagged, rather than the simple fact that

by ending the quotation and beginning it again after the interruption,
as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>Who-e debel you?</q> — he at last said — <q>you
no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q>  And so saying, the lighted
tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</p></egXML>
If it is important to convey the idea that the two <gi>q</gi>
elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes
<att>next</att> and
<att>prev</att> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
          <p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or
speaker, using the <att>who</att> attribute, whether or not the
source is given in the text, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="Wilson">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this
day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he
says:—<q who="Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that
I was a red-headed man.</q></q></egXML>
 This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded
within other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker
(Spaulding).</p>
          <p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation
marks are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the
quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the
text, the <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to record the way
in which they were rendered in the copy text.</p>
          <p>As with highlighting, it is not always possible and may not be
considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a
text in this way.  In such cases, the tag <gi>hi rend="quoted"</gi>
might be used to mark quoted text without making any claim as to its
status.<!----></p>

        <div xml:id="z636">
          <head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head>
          <p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts
may be tagged as such in one of two ways. If the word or phrase is
already tagged for some reason, the element indicated should bear a
value for the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute indicating the
language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element
<gi>foreign</gi> may be used, again using the <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute.  For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>John has real
<foreign xml:lang="fra">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p><p>Have you read <title xml:lang="deu">Die Dreigroschenoper</title>?</p><p><mentioned xml:lang="fra">Savoir-faire</mentioned> is French for
know-how.</p><p>The court issued a writ of <term xml:lang="lat">mandamus</term>.</p></egXML></p>
          <p>As these examples show, the <gi>foreign</gi> element should not
be used to tag foreign words if some other more specific element such
as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>mentioned</gi>, or <gi>term</gi> applies.
The global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be attached to any
element to show that it uses some other language than that of the
surrounding text.</p>
          <p>The codes used to identify languages, supplied on the
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute, must be constructed in a particular
way, and must conform to common Internet standards<note place="foot">The relevant standards are RFC 3066, and the lists of two

explained in the relevant section of the TEI Guidelines. Some simple example

Where possible, the body of a note should be inserted in the
text at the point at which its identifier or mark first appears. This
may not be possible for example with marginalia, which may not be
anchored to an exact location.  For simplicity, it may be adequate to
position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other
element.  Notes may also be placed in a separate division of the text
(as end-notes are, in printed books) and linked to the relevant
portion of the text using their <att>target</att> attribute.</p>
        <p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply the number
or identifier of a note if this is required.  The <att>resp</att>
attribute should be used consistently to distinguish between authorial
and editorial notes, if the work has both kinds; otherwise, the TEI
header should state which kind they are.</p>

discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
        <div xml:id="ptrs">
          <head>Simple Cross References</head>
          <p>A cross reference from one point within a single document to
another can be encoded using either of the following elements:

<specList><specDesc key="ref"/><specDesc key="ptr"/></specList>
<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>ref</gi></label><item>a reference to another location in the current document, in
terms of one or more identifiable elements, possibly modified by
additional text or comment.</item><label><gi>ptr</gi></label><item>a pointer to another location in the current document in terms
of one or more identifiable elements.</item></list></p>
  <p>These elements share the following attributes:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>target</att></label><item>specifies the destination of the pointer as one or more SGML
identifiers</item><label><att>type</att></label><item>categorizes the pointer in some respect, using any convenient
set of categories.</item><label><att>targType</att></label><item>specifies the type (or types)  of element to which this pointer
may point.</item><label><att>crDate</att></label><item>specifies when
this pointer was
made.</item><label><att>resp</att></label><item>specifies the creator
of the pointer.</item></list>-->
</p>
          <p>The difference between these two elements is that <gi>ptr</gi> is
an empty element, simply marking a point from which a link is to be
made, whereas <gi>ref</gi> may contain some text as well —
typically the text of the cross-reference itself. The <gi>ptr</gi>
element would be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated by
some non-verbal means such as a symbol or icon, or in an electronic
text by a button. It is also useful in document production systems,
where the formatter can generate the correct verbal form of the cross
reference.</p>
          <p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent
(assuming we have documented somewhere the exact verbal form of cross
references represented by <gi>ptr</gi> elements):
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on page
       34</ref>.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML>  The value of the
      <att>target</att> attribute must have been used as the 
identifier of some other element within the current document.  This implies that the
passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, and must
therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following
example, the cross reference is to a
<gi>div</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">    ...
    see especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.
    ...
    <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning Identifiers</head>
     ...</div></egXML>
 </p>
          <p>Because the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is global, any element in
a document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a
paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">    ...
    this is discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref>
    ...
    <p xml:id="pspec">Links may be made to any kind of element
    ...</p></egXML></p>
          <p>The <att>targType</att> attribute can be used to specify that
the element pointed to must be of a particular type, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">    ...
    this is discussed in <ref target="#dspec" targType="div body">
    the section on links</ref></egXML></p>
          <p>This reference should fail if the element with identifier
<val>dspec</val> is neither a <gi>div</gi> nor a <gi>body</gi>.
<!-- Note however that this additional check cannot be carried out by an
      SGML or XML parser 
alone, since such parsers can only check that some element
<att>dspec</att> exists.--></p>
          <p>The <att>type</att> attribute can be used to categorize the
link represented by the pointer in any convenient way. The
<att>resp</att> and <att>crDate</att> attributes may also be
used to represent the person or agency responsible for making the
link, and its date of creation, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">    ...
   this is discussed in
   <ref type="xref" resp="auto" crdate="950521" target="#dspec">
   the section on links</ref></egXML> These attributes are most likely to be of use in hypertext
systems containing very many pointers used for a variety of purposes
and created by a variety of means.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference  does not correspond
with any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an
element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the
current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an
<gi>anchor</gi> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is
some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <gi>seg</gi> element
may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as
follows:
<specList><specDesc key="anchor"/><specDesc key="seg"/></specList>
<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>anchor</gi></label><item>specifies a location or point within a document so that it may
be pointed to.</item><label><gi>seg</gi></label><item>identifies a span or segment of text within a document so that
it may be pointed to. Attributes include
<list type="gloss"><label><att>type</att></label><item>categorizes the
segment</item></list></item></list>-->
</p>
          <p>In the following (imaginary) example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have
been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in
some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in
the second, to a sequence of words:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">  Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I dozed
  off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three
  words</ref> had been circled in red by a previous reader</egXML></p>
          <p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified
identifiers (<att>ABCD</att> and <att>EFGH</att> in this
example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document.
Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers,
the <gi>anchor</gi> and
<gi>seg</gi> elements may be used:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">  .... <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> ....
   ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ... </seg> ...</egXML></p>
          <p>The <att>type</att> attribute should be used (as above) to
distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general purpose
elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are  discussed in
section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="xptrs">
          <head>Pointing to other documents</head>
          <p>So far, we have shown how the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and
<gi>ref</gi> may be used for cross-references or links whose targets
occur within the same document as their source. However, the same
elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML
document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a database
component.
This is possible because the value of the <att>target</att> attribute
may be any valid <term>universal resource indicator</term> (URI). A
full definition of this
term, defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development
and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this
tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the
familiar <soCalled>URL</soCalled> used to indicate a web page, such as
<code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. </p>
          <p>A URL may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
<code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>.  The sharp sign
indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be
located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this
example will therefore locate an element which has an
<att>xml:id</att> attribute value of <val>SEC2</val> within the
document retrieved from <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>.
In the examples we have discussed so far, the part to the left of the
sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the
referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p>
          <p>Within a URL, parts of an XML document can be specified by means of
other more sophisticated mechanisms, using a special language called
Xpath, also defined by the W3C.  This is particularly useful where the
elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must therefore be
located by some other means.  A full specification of the language is
well beyond the scope of this document; here we provide only a flavour
of its power. </p>
          <p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of
<term>steps</term>, each one identifying some part of the document,
often in terms of the locations identified by the previous step.  For
example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph
of chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second
paragraph in the second step, and the third sentence in the last step.
A step can be defined in terms of the document tree itself, using such
concepts as <val>parent</val>, <val>descendent</val>,
<val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more loosely, in terms of text
patterns, word or character positions. </p>
<!--
  <p>The first step in a location path will often be to specify the
identifier of some element within the target document, as in this
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ptr target="#SA"/></egXML>  This selects the whole of whatever element bears the
identifier
<att>SA</att>. If a
finer-grained target is required, other steps might follow. The
following keywords are available for you to select other elements in
terms of their relationship to this one:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>child</att></label><item>elements contained by this one.</item><label><att>ancestor</att></label><item>elements which contains this one, directly or indirectly.</item><label><att>previous</att></label><item>elements with the same parent as this one but preceding it in
the document.</item><label><att>next</att></label><item>elements with the same parent as this one and following it in
the document.</item><label><att>preceding</att></label><item>elements in the document which start before this one does,
irrespective of their parents.</item><label><att>following</att></label><item>elements in the document which start after this one does,
irrespective of their parents.</item></list></p>
  <p>Each of these keywords implies a particular set of elements (the
set of children, the set of ancestors, the set of previous siblings,
etc.); to specify which element in the set we are pointing at, the
keyword may optionally be followed by a parenthesized list containing:
<list type="simple"><item>a positive or negative number, indicating which of the possibly
many elements found is intended (+1 indicating the first element
encountered, starting from the current location, and -1 indicating the
last), or the keyword <val>all</val>, indicating that all the elements
in the set are to be pointed at;</item><item>a generic identifier, indicating the type of element required,
or a star indicating that any element type will do;</item><item>a set of attribute names and values, indicating that the
element selected should have attributes with the names and values
specified, if any.</item></list></p>
  <p>Continuing the above example, the following reference will select
the third <gi>p</gi> element directly contained by whatever element
has the identifier <att>SA</att>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ptr target="#SA child (3 p)"/></egXML></p>
  <p>Similarly, assuming that the entity <att>P3</att> is in fact
a reference to the XML form of the TEI Guidelines, then the following
reference will select section 14.2.2 of that publication in which (as
it happens) the extended pointer syntax is formally defined:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For full details, see
<ref doc="P3" from="id (SA) child (2 div) child (2 div)">
  TEI Extended pointer syntax definition
</ref></egXML></p>
  <p>Normally, the scope  of a cross reference will be adequately
defined by the <att>from</att> attribute. For some  documents,
however, it may be more convenient to define both a starting and an
ending scope. As noted above, the <att>to</att> attribute is
provided for this purpose. For example,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">  <ptr doc="P1" from="id (xyz)" to="id (abc)"/></egXML> is an extended pointer whose target is the sequence starting
at the beginning of whatever element in document <att>P1</att>
has identifier <att>XYZ</att> and ending at the end of whatever
element in the same document has identifier <att>ABC</att>. Any
elements in between are also included, irrespective of structure; the
pointer is erroneous if the end of <att>ABC</att> precedes the
start of <att>XYZ</att>. </p>
  <p>Very complex specifications are easily built using this syntax.
For example, the following reference will select the most recent <gi>head</gi>
element which carries an attribute <att>lang</att> with the value
<val>LAT</val>, and which occurs before the start of the element with
identifier
<att>SA</att>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ptr doc="P3" from="id (SA) preceding (1 head lang lat)"/></egXML></p>
  <p>If no value is supplied for the <att>doc</att> attribute, the
current document is assumed. Thus, the following references are
semantically equivalent. They both indicate the element with
identifier
<att>X1</att> within the current document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ptr target="#X1"/>
<ptr from="id (X1)"/></egXML></p>

        <div xml:id="xatts">
          <head>Special kinds of Linking</head>
          <p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are
defined for every element in the TEI Lite scheme:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>ana</att></label><item>links an element with its interpretation.</item><label><att>corresp</att></label><item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item><label><att>next</att></label><item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item><label><att>prev</att></label><item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item></list></p>
          <p>The <att>ana</att> (analysis) attribute is intended for use
where a set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined
somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section
<ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence
<q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg type="sentence" ana="SVO"><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg></seg></egXML>  This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the
document of elements with identifiers <val>SVO</val>, <val>NP1</val>,
and
<val>VV1</val> where the significance of these particular codes
is explained. Note the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark
particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the <att>type</att>
attribute.</p>
          <p>The <att>corresp</att> (corresponding) attribute provides a
simple way of representing some form of correspondence between two
elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be
used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg lang="FRA" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean aime Nancy</seg><seg lang="ENG" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves Nancy</seg></egXML></p>
          <p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the
following example, it has been used to represent anaphoric
correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the show</q>
and <q>Shirley</q>, and between
<q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which made
its Friday night debut only a month ago, was
not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule,
although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc">the network</seg>
says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley">the show</seg>
still is being considered.</p></egXML></p>
          <p>The <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes
provide a simple way of linking together the components of a
discontinuous  element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q>
— he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e,

          <p>As an example, consider this extract from the quarto printing of
Shakespeare's <title>Henry V</title>. 
<eg> ... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a table of green
feelds</eg>
</p>
          <p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here,
specifically to modernize (or normalise) the Elizabethan spellings of 
<mentioned>a'</mentioned> and
<mentioned>feelds</mentioned> for <mentioned>he</mentioned> and
<mentioned>fields</mentioned> respectively. He or she might also want
to emend  <mentioned>table</mentioned> to
<mentioned>babbl'd</mentioned>, following an editorial tradition that
goes back to the 18th century Shakesperean scholar  Theobald. The
following encoding would then be appropriate:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and <reg>he</reg>
 <corr resp="Gifford">babbl'd</corr> of green
<reg>fields</reg></egXML></p>
          <p>A more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want
to retain the original, but at the same time signal that some
of the readings it contains are in some sense anomalous:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and <orig>a</orig>
 <sic>table</sic> of green
<orig>feelds</orig></egXML></p>
          <p>Finally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both
possibilities in a single composite text, using the <gi>choice</gi>
element.

<specList><specDesc key="choice"/></specList>


This allows an editor to mark where alternative readings are possible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was

          <p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by
the transcriber, or (in manuscript material) by the author or scribe.
For example, if the source for an electronic text read

<eg>The following elements are provided for for simple editorial
interventions.</eg> then it might be felt desirable to correct the
obvious error, but at the same time to record the deletion of the
superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus:

          <p>If the source read<eg>The following elements provided for

inadvertently dropped) then the corrected text might read:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements <add resp="#LB">are</add> provided for
simple editorial interventions.</egXML></p>
          <p>These elements are not limited to changes made by an editor; they
can also be used to record authorial changes in manuscripts.  A
manuscript in which the author has first written <q>How it galls me,
what a galling shadow</q>, then crossed out the word
<mentioned>galls</mentioned> and inserted <mentioned>dogs</mentioned>
might be encoded thus:

          <p>Like names, dates, and numbers, abbreviations may be transcribed

<mentioned>organization</mentioned>, etc., describing the nature of
the object referred to.</item></list></item></list>-->
</p>
          <p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing
semi-lexical items such as acronyms or jargon:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">We can sum up the above discussion as follows:  the identity of a

          <p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish

<!--, and the <att>expan</att>
attribute may be used to supply an expansion:

          <p>The <gi>expan</gi> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by
an encoder. This element is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript
materials. For example, the
character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional
representation for the word <val>per</val> is commonly encountered in
Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>per</expan></egXML>
</p>
          <p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not
always contain the same letters as the abbreviation. Where it does,
however, common editorial practice is  to italicize or otherwise
signal which letters have been supplied. The <gi>expan</gi> element
should not be used for this purpose since its function is to indicate an
expanded form, not a part of one. 
For example, consider the common
abbreviation <val>wt</val> (for <val>with</val>) found in medieval
texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to represent this as
<soCalled>w<hi>i</hi>t<hi>h</hi></soCalled>, italicising the
letters not found in the source. An appropriate encoding for this
purpose would be 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>w<hi>i</hi>t<hi>h</hi></expan></egXML>
</p>
          <p>To record both an
abbreviation and its expansion, the <gi>choice</gi> element mentioned
above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed
expansion: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice></egXML>

        <head>Names, Dates, and  Numbers</head>
        <p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of
<soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features which may appear almost
anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of
particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to
objects external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and
places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular problems for many
natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety
of ways in which they may be presented within a text. The elements
described here, by making such features explicit, reduce the
complexity of processing texts containing them.</p>
        <div xml:id="nomen">
          <head>Names and Referring Strings</head>
          <p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some
person, place, object, etc. Two elements are provided to mark such
strings:

<specList><specDesc key="rs"/><specDesc key="name"/></specList>
<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>rs</gi></label><item>contains a general purpose name or referring string. Attributes
include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>type</att></label><item>indicates more specifically the object referred to by the
referencing string. Values might include <code>person</code>,
<code>place</code>, <code>ship</code>, <code>element</code>, etc.</item></list></item><label><gi>name</gi></label><item>contains a proper noun or noun phrase. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>type</att></label><item>indicates the type of the object which is being named by the
phrase.</item></list></item></list>  -->
  </p>
          <p>  The <att>type</att> attribute is used to distinguish
amongst (for example) names of persons, places and organizations,
where this is possible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>, </q>
said his lady to him one day, <q>have you heard
that <rs type="place">Netherfield Park</rs> is let
at last?</q></egXML><!-- Austen Pride and Prejudice, chap 1 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">It being one of the principles of the
<rs type="organization">Circumlocution Office</rs> never,
on any account whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer,
<rs type="person">Mr Barnacle</rs> said, <q>Possibly.</q></egXML><!-- Little Dorrit, peng ed, p 153 --></p>
          <p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be
used for any reference to a person, place, etc, not necessarily one in
the form of a proper noun or noun phrase.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>,</q>
said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him
one day...</egXML></p>
          <p>The <gi>name</gi> element by contrast is provided for the special
case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may
be used synonymously with the <gi>rs</gi> element, or nested within
it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper
nouns.</p>
          <p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to
enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms
usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the
text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague.  Moreover, name
prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>,
 may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name,
depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p>
          <p>The <att>key</att>  attribute provides an alternative normalized identifier for the object being named,
like  a database record key. It  may thus be useful as a means
of gathering together all references to the same individual or
location scattered throughout a document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person" key="BENM1">Mr. Bennet</rs>,
  </q> said <rs type="person" key="BENM2">his lady</rs>
  to him one day, <q>have you heard that
  <rs type="place" key="NETP1">Netherfield Park</rs>
  is let at last?</q></egXML></p>
          <p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the
<gi>reg</gi> (regularization) element, which provides a means
of marking the standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated
below:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><name type="person" key="WADLM1"><choice><sic>Walter de la Mare</sic><reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg></choice></name> was born at
  <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in
  <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</egXML><!-- Frank Swinnerton, The Georgian Literary Scene, 1938, p. 195 --></p>
          <p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="indexing"/> may be
more appropriate if the function of the regularization is to provide a
consistent index:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a large parish.
At the time of the events which led to
<name type="person">Fournier</name>'s <index><term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques Fournier)</term></index>
investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250 inhabitants.</p></egXML>
<!-- E.L Ladurie: Montaillou, Penguin 1980, p3 -->
	<!-- but should we quote the French? (LB) -->

 Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have
 two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its
 regularised form must be repeated many times; and the burden of
 additional XML markup in the body of the text may be inconvenient to
 maintain and complex to process. For applications such as onomastics,
 relating to persons or places named rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed
analysis of the component parts of a name is needed, the full TEI
Guidelines provide a range of other solutions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Dates and Times</head>
          <p>Tags for the more detailed encoding of times and dates include the
following:
<specList><specDesc key="date"/><specDesc key="time"/></specList>
</p>
          <p>The <att>value</att> attribute specifies a normalized form
for the date or time, using one of the standard formats defined by  ISO 8601.
Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>,
<q>September 1990</q>,
<q>twelvish</q>) can  be expressed
by  omitting a part of the value supplied, as in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date value="1980-02-21">21 Feb 1980</date><date value="1990">1990</date><date value="1990-09">September 1990</date><date value="--09">September</date><date value="2001-09-11T12:48:00">Sept 11th, 12 minutes before 9 am</date></egXML>Note in the last example the use of a normalized representation for
the date string which includes a time: this example could thus equally
well be tagged using the <gi>time</gi> element.

          <p>Numbers can be written with either letters or digits (<code>twenty-one</code>,

language-dependent (e.g. English <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes
Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English <mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned>
equals French
<mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>). In natural-language processing or
machine-translation applications, it is often helpful to distinguish
them from other, more <soCalled>lexical</soCalled> parts of the text.
In other applications, the ability to record a number's value in
standard notation is important. The <gi>num</gi> element provides
this possibility:
<specList><specDesc key="num"/></specList>
<!--

an item label (in a glossary list, this label is the term being

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list><head>A short list</head><item>First item in list.</item><item>Second item in list.</item><item>Third item in list.</item></list><list><head>A short list</head><item n="1">First item in list.</item><item n="2">Second item in list.</item><item n="3">Third item in list.</item></list><list><head>A short list</head><label>1</label><item>First item in list.</item><label>2</label><item>Second item in list.</item><label>3</label><item>Third item in list.</item></list></egXML> The styles should not be mixed in the same list.</p>
        <p>A simple two-column table may be treated as a <term>glossary
list</term>, tagged <gi>list type="gloss"</gi>.  Here, each item
comprises a <term>term</term> and a <term>gloss</term>, marked with
<gi>label</gi> and <gi>item</gi> respectively.  These correspond to
the elements <gi>term</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi>, which can occur
anywhere in prose text.

        <p>Where the internal structure of a list item is more complex, it
may be preferable to regard the list as a <term>table</term>, for
which special-purpose tagging is defined below (<ptr target="#U5-tables"/>).
</p>
        <p>Lists of whatever kind can, of course, nest within list items to
any depth required. Here, for example, a glossary list contains two
items, each of which is itself a simple list:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss"><label>EVIL</label><item><list type="simple"><item>I am cast upon a horrible desolate island, void
          of all hope of recovery.</item><item>I am singled out and separated as it were from
         all the world to be miserable.</item><item>I am divided from mankind — a solitaire; one
           banished from human society.</item></list><!-- end of first nested list --></item><label>GOOD</label><item><list type="simple"><item>But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my
              ship's company were.</item><item>But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's

            affording no sustenances....</item></list><!-- end of second nested list --></item></list><!-- end of glossary list --></egXML><!-- D Defoe,  Robinson Crusoe  --></p>
        <p>A list need not necessarily be displayed in list format.  For
example,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>On those remote pages it is written that animals are

        <p>Tables represent a  challenge for any text processing
system, but simple tables, at least, appear in so many texts that even
in the simplified TEI tag set presented here, markup for tables is
necessary.  The following  elements are provided for this purpose:

Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>rows</att></label><item>indicates the

that still doesn't provide for the extra elements.--><!--SQ table

      <div xml:id="U5-figs" type="Section">
        <head>Figures and Graphics</head>
        <p>Not all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The
most straightforward text will often contain diagrams or
illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and text are
inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are
complementary. </p>
        <p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the
text, possibly with a brief description of its content, by using the
elements described in this section. The same elements may also be used
to embed digitized versions of the graphic within an electronic
document.
<specList><specDesc key="graphic"/><specDesc key="figure"/><!--</gi></label><item>marks the spot at which a graphic is to be inserted in a
document. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>entity</att></label><item>the name of a pre-defined system entity containing a digitized
version of the graphic to be inserted.</item>--><specDesc key="figDesc"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains a textual description of the appearance or content of
a graphic, for use when documenting an image without displaying
it.</item>--></specList></p>
        <p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a
heading and/or caption, may be included within the <gi>figure</gi>
element itself, in a <gi>head</gi> and one or more <gi>p</gi>
elements, as may also any text appearing within the graphic itself. It
is strongly recommended that a prose description of the image be
supplied, as the content of a <gi>figDesc</gi> element, for the use
of applications which are not able to render the graphic, and to
render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text
is not normally considered part of the document proper.)</p>
        <p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a
graphic and provide a link to it, as in this example;
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="412"/><graphic url="p412fig.png"/><pb n="413"/></egXML>
This indicates that the graphic contained by the file
<ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears between pages 412 and 413. </p>
        <p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element can appear
anywhere  that textual content is permitted, within but not between
paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has
decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head></egXML> </p>
        <p>More usually, a graphic will have at the
least an identifying title, which may be encoded using the <gi>head</gi>
element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a
particular structure. It is also often convenient to include a brief description of
the image.  The <gi>figure</gi> element provides a means of wrapping
one or more such elements together as a kind of graphic
<soCalled>block</soCalled>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><figure><graphic url="fessipic.png"/><head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head><figDesc>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading
       a group of revellers.</figDesc></figure></egXML></p>
        <p>When a digitized version of the graphic concerned is available, it
may be  embedded  at the appropriate point within the
document in this way.</p>

      <div xml:id="U5-anal" type="Section">
        <head>Interpretation and  Analysis</head>
        <p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of
interpretation or analysis.  While it is certainly difficult, and may
be impossible, to distinguish firmly between
<soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled>
information in any universal way, it remains true that judgments
concerning the latter are typically regarded as more likely to provide
controversy than  those concerning the former.  Many scholars
therefore prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible
to alert the reader that they are considered more open to dispute,
than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of the
elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p>
        <div>
          <head>Orthographic Sentences</head>
          <p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with
no  particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary
to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into
discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label
for use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>.  To
facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest
within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the
following element:
<specList><specDesc key="s"/></specList></p>
          <p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly
used (in linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic
sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such
as punctuation.  For example, the passage from
<title>Jane Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into
s-units as follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="474"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s><s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s><s n="003">he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s><s n="004">When we got back from church, I went
into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking 
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, 
and I said —</s></p><p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester
this morning.</s></q> ... </p></div></egXML> 
Note that  <gi>s</gi>
elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <gi>s</gi> element implies
that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown
above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that
every word in the text being analysed will be contained by exactly one
<gi>s</gi> element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a
unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the
document, then the <att>xml:id</att> attribute might be used in
preference to the <att>n</att> used in the above  example.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head>
          <p>A more general purpose segmentation element, the <gi>seg</gi> has
  already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked
  targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level portion of text
  to which the encoder may assign a user-specified <att>type</att>, as
  well as a unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual
  features for which there is no provision in the published TEI
  Guidelines.</p>
          <p>For example, the Guidelines provide no
  <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts of a literary
  text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer)
  directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the
  <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished from others by an appropriate
  value for the <att>who</att> attribute. A possibly simpler, and
  certainly more general, solution would however be to use the
  <gi>seg</gi> element as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg>
A quiet wedding we had: ...</p></div></egXML> 

The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element
can take any value, and so can be used to record phrase-level
phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used
and their significance in the header.</p>
          <p>A <gi>seg</gi> element of one type (unlike the <gi>s</gi>
element which it superficially resembles) can be nested within a <gi>seg</gi>
element of the same or another type. This enables quite complex
structures to be represented; some examples were given in section
<ptr target="#xatts"/> above. However, because it must respect the
requirement that elements be properly nested, and may not cut
across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement to
associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which
may completely ignore the document hierarchy. It also requires that
the interpretation itself be represented by a single coded value in
the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
          <p>Neither restriction applies to the <gi>interp</gi> element, which
provides powerful features for the encoding of quite complex
interpretive information in a relatively straightforward manner.

<specList><specDesc key="interp"/><specDesc key="interpGrp"/></specList>


These elements allows the encoder to specify both the class of
an interpretation, and the particular instance of that class which the
interpretation involves. Thus, whereas with <gi>seg</gi> one can say
simply that something is an apostrophe, with
<gi>interp</gi> one can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a
larger class (rhetorical figures).</p>
          <p>Moreover, <gi>interp</gi>  is an empty element, which must be
linked to the passage to which it applies either by means of the
<att>ana</att>  attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>
 above, or by means of its own <att>inst</att> attribute. This
means that any kind of analysis can be represented, with no need to
respect the document hierarchy, and also facilitates the grouping
of analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose <gi>interpGrp</gi>
element is provided for the latter purpose.</p>
          <p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of
a text as  themes or subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the
locations of individual scenes of the narrative. Different portions of
our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example, might
be associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe, hyperbole,
and metaphor; with subject-matter references to churches, servants,
cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and with scenes located in
the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified location (drawing
room?).</p>
          <p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the <gi>text</gi>
element; it is however good practice to put them all in the same place
(e.g. a separate section of the front or back matter), as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interp xml:id="fig-apos-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figure of speech" value="apostrophe"/><interp xml:id="fig-hyp-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figure of speech" value="hyperbole"/><!-- ... --><interp xml:id="set-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="setting" value="church"/><!-- ... --><interp xml:id="ref-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference" value="church"/><interp xml:id="ref-serv-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference" value="servants"/><!-- ... --></p></div></back></egXML><!-- the best place for this list would be in the ANALYSIS
--><!-- element of the header, but meta class elements are only --><!--
allowed within TEXT.  bug, perhaps.  or nwi. --><!-- aye capn definitely looks like a bug to me (lb) --></p>
          <p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably
reduced by using the <gi>interpGrp</gi> element to group together all
those <gi>interp</gi> elements which share common attribute values,
as follows: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interpGrp type="figure of speech" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="fig-apos" value="apostrophe"/><interp xml:id="fig-hyp" value="hyperbole"/><interp xml:id="fig-meta" value="metaphor"/><!-- ... --></interpGrp><interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="set-church" value="church"/><interp xml:id="set-kitch" value="kitchen"/><interp xml:id="set-unspec" value="unspecified"/><!-- ... --></interpGrp><interpGrp type="reference" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="ref-church" value="church"/><interp xml:id="ref-serv" value="servants"/><interp xml:id="ref-cook" value="cooking"/><!-- ... --></interpGrp></p></div></back></egXML></p>
          <p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be
linked with the parts of the text to which they apply in either or
both of two ways. The <att>ana</att> attribute can be used on
whichever element is appropriate:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p xml:id="P38.1" ana="#set-church #set-kitch"/><s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="#fig-apos">Reader, I married him.</s>
...</div></egXML> 
Note in this example that since the paragraph has two settings
(in the church  and in the kitchen), the identifiers of both have been
supplied.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the <gi>interp</gi> elements can point to all the
parts of the text to which they apply, using their <att>inst</att>
attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="fig-apos-2" type="figure of speech" resp="#LB-MSM" value="apostrophe" inst="#P38.1.1"/><!-- ... --><interp xml:id="set-church-2" type="scene-setting" value="church" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM"/><interp xml:id="set-kitchen-2" type="scene-setting" value="kitchen" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM"/><!-- ... --></egXML></p>
          <p>The <gi>interp</gi> is not limited to any particular type of
analysis, The literary analysis shown above is but one possibility;
one could equally well use <gi>interp</gi> to capture a linguistic
part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in
section <ptr target="#xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which
might be represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos" value="noun phrase, singular"/><interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos" value="inflected verb, present-tense singular"/>

          <p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to
encode a passage from a tutorial introducing the Fortran programming
language:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>It is traditional to introduce a language with a program like the
following:
<eg>
   CHAR*12 GRTG
   GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD'
   PRINT *, GRTG
   END
</eg></p><p>This simple example first declares a variable <ident>GRTG</ident>, in
the line <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>, which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident>
as consisting of 12 bytes of type <ident>CHAR</ident>.  To this variable,
the value <val>HELLO WORLD</val>
is then assigned.</p></egXML></p>
          <p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be
instructed to format examples appropriately (e.g. to preserve line
breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use of tags such
as <gi>ident</gi> greatly facilitates the
construction of a useful index.</p>
          <p>The <gi>formula</gi> element should be used to enclose a
mathematical or chemical formula presented within the text as a
distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety of
special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text,
it will usually be necessary to present the body of the formula in a
specialized notation. The notation used should be specified by the
<att>notation</att> attribute, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><formula notation="tex">
  \begin{math}E = mc^{2}\end{math}
</formula></egXML></p>
<!-- need something on mathml here -->
          <p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the
subject of discussion within a technical document, itself encoded in
XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to distinguish
clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up
the document itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One
      simple solution is to use the predefined entity reference
      <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent each &lt; character which marks
      the start of an XML tag within the examples. A more
general solution is to mark off the whole body of each example as
containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the
parser. This is achieved by enclosing it within  a special XML
construct called a <term><code>CDATA</code> marked section</term>,  as
in the following example:
<eg>&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as follows:
&lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [
   &lt;list&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;First item in the list&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
]]&gt;
&lt;/eg&gt;
The &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;
elements.</eg></p>
          <p>The <gi>list</gi> element used within the example above will not
be regarded as forming part of the document proper, because it is
embedded within a marked section (beginning with the special markup
declaration <val>&lt;![CDATA[ </val>, and ending with
<val>]]&gt;</val>).</p>
          <p>Note also the use of the <gi>gi</gi> element to tag references to
element names (or <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the
body of the text.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Generated Divisions</head>
          <p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to
generate automatically whole sections such as a table of contents or
an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to mark the location
at which such a generated section should be placed.
<specList><specDesc key="divGen"/></specList></p>
          <p>The <gi>divGen</gi> element can be placed anywhere that a
division element would be legal, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><front><titlePage> ... </titlePage><divGen type="toc"/><div type="Preface"><head>Preface</head> ... </div></front><body> ... </body><back><div><head>Appendix</head> ... </div><divGen type="index" n="Index"/></back></egXML></p>
          <p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <att>type</att>
attribute to distinguish the different kinds of division to be
generated: in the first case a table of contents (a
<mentioned>toc</mentioned>) and in the second an index.</p>
          <p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded
(rather than one being generated) for some reason, the
<gi>list</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-lists"/>
should be used. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="indexing">
          <head>Index Generation</head>
          <p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged
document is generally unproblematic for an automatic processor, the
production of a good quality index will often require more careful
tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts
tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all
occurrences of elements such as <gi>term</gi> or <gi>name</gi> will
often be a good departure point for an index. </p>
          <p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag which
may be used to mark both the parts of the document which should be
indexed, and how the indexing should be done.
<specList><specDesc key="index"/></specList></p>
          <p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include
the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...
TEI lite also provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag
<index><term>indexing</term></index>
<index><term>index (tag)</term><index><term>use in index generation</term></index></index>
which may be used ...</egXML></p>
          <p>The <gi>index</gi> element can also be used to provide a form of
interpretive or analytic information.  For example, in a study of
Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's references to
different figures, for comparative stylistic study.  In the following
lines of the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record
the poet's references to Jupiter (as
<mentioned>deus</mentioned>, <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the
subject of <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form
number 227]), to Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as
<mentioned>imago tauri fallacis</mentioned> and the subject of
<mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot">The
analysis is taken, with permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton
Wright, <title>An Analytical Onomasticon to the Metamorphoses of Ovid</title>
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming).  Some
simplifications have been undertaken.</note>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l n="3.001">iamque deus posita fallacis imagine tauri</l><l n="3.002">se confessus erat Dictaeaque rura tenebat</l></egXML> This need might be met using the <gi>note</gi> element
discussed in section in <ptr target="#U5-notes"/>, or with the <gi>interp</gi>
element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. Here we demonstrate
how it might also be satisfied by using the <gi>index</gi> element.</p>
          <p>We assume that the object is to generate more than one index: one
for names of deities (called <att>dn</att>), another for
onomastic references (called <att>on</att>), <!-- ??? or maybe
not - I haven't the faintest idea myself --> a third for pronominal
references (called <att>pr</att>) and so forth. One way of
achieving this might be as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l n="3.001">iamque deus posita fallacis imagine tauri
     <index indexname="dn"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>deus</term></index></index>
     <index indexname="on"><term>Iuppiter (taurus)</term><index><term>imago tauri fallacis</term></index></index></l><l n="3.002">se confessus erat Dictaeaque rura tenebat
     <index indexname="pr"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>se</term></index></index>
     <index indexname="v"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>confiteor (v227)</term></index></index></l></egXML>  For each <gi>index</gi> element above, an entry will be
generated in the appropriate index, using  as headword the content of
the <gi>term</gi> element it contains; the <gi>term</gi> elements
nested within the secondary <gi>index</gi> element in each case
provide a secondary keyword. The actual reference will be taken from the context
in which the <gi>index</gi> element appears, i.e. in this case the
identifier of the <gi>l</gi> element containing it. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Addresses</head>
          <p>The <gi>address</gi> element is used to mark a postal address of
any kind. It contains one or more <gi>addrLine</gi> elements, one for
each line of the address.
<specList><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="addrLine"/></specList>
<!--
<list type="gloss"><label><att>address</att></label><item>contains a postal or other address, for example of a publisher,
an organization, or an individual.</item><label><att>addrLine</att></label><item>contains one line of a postal or other address.</item></list>--></p>
          <p>Here is a simple example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address><addrLine>Computer Center (M/C 135)</addrLine><addrLine>1940 W. Taylor, Room 124</addrLine><addrLine>Chicago, IL 60612-7352</addrLine><addrLine>U.S.A.</addrLine></address></egXML></p>
          <p>The individual parts of an address may be further distinguished by
 using the <gi>name</gi> element discussed above (section <ptr target="#nomen"/>).
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address><addrLine>Computer Center (M/C 135)</addrLine><addrLine>1940 W. Taylor, Room 124</addrLine><addrLine><name type="city">Chicago</name>, IL 60612-7352</addrLine><addrLine><name type="country">USA</name></addrLine></address></egXML></p>

      <div xml:id="U5-chars" type="Section">
        <head>Character Sets, Diacritics, etc.</head>
        <p>With the advent of XML and its adoption of Unicode as the required
     character set for all documents, most problems previously
     associated with the representation of the divers languages and
     writing systems of the world are greatly reduced. For those
     working with standard forms of the European languages in
     particular, almost no special action is needed: any XML editor
     should enable you to input accented letters or other <soCalled>non-ASCII</soCalled>
     characters directly, and they should be stored in the resulting
     file in a way which is transferable directly between different
     systems. </p>
        <p>There are two important exceptions: the characters &amp; and &lt; may not be
entered directly in an XML document, since they have a special
significance as initiating markup. They must always be represented as
<term>entity references</term>, like this: <code>&amp;amp;</code> or
<code>&amp;lt;</code>. Other characters may also be represented by
means of entity reference where necessary, for example to retain
compatibility with a pre-Unicode processing system. </p>
<!-- <p>For compatability with other older systems, however, the TEI Lite
     DTD includes declarations for a number of the most widely used
     character entities, so that such characters may be entered and
     saved as character mnemonics. </p>-->
<!--
the TEI recommendations for character set use are simple.  For local
use, use whatever character set is supported by your machine and your
software.  If your software makes direct keyboard entry of special
characters difficult, you may elect to define your own keyboarding
conventions (for example to represent accented letters by typing the
appropriate accent immediately after the letter, or by using special
sequences unlikely to appear in normal text such as <mentioned>aE</mentioned>
for
<mentioned>ä</mentioned>). Global search and replace functions
can then be used to turn these keyboard shorthands into the proper
characters. If you work with non-Latin scripts and there is a standard
transliteration scheme in your field (e.g. for ancient Greek the beta
code of the Thesaurus Linguæ Græcæ), use it.  Any
transliteration used should be reversible (this rules out a surprising
number of schemes commonly used in normal writing) and will be most
usable if it requires no special ligatures, ties, or diacritics (this
rules out a surprising number of the remainder).</p>
<p>For interchange of files among systems, use SGML entity references
to replace all characters not in the following list of characters
which almost always survive electronic interchange intact:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
" % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? _   (space)</egXML>This list excludes the following characters which, to the
frequent annoyance of unsuspecting users, often do not survive
transfer across national boundaries or over standard wide-area
networks.  If you're just going from your Mac to your PC, though,
these characters will probably be safe:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">! # $ [ \ ] ^ ` { } | ~</egXML></p>
<p>To ensure proper transmission across multi-vendor networks, entity
references must be used for all accented and extended-Latin
characters, all non-Latin characters, and all symbols not on
conventional computer keyboards.</p> -->
<!-- <p>You may use your own entity names in TEI-conformant files, if
you wish and if you provide entity declarations for
them, mapping the name to the appropriate Unicode value. The standard names (though long-winded) have the advantage
of clarity; the characters intended are reasonably clear to any
speaker of English who recognizes that a character is being named,
often even without recourse to any list.  This is not true of many
older schemes for representing accented characters.</p>-->
<!--<p>The entity names needed for the characters listed above as
<soCalled>unsafe</soCalled> and for the accented characters of some
major Western European languages are given below. Lists of public
entity sets and their contents are available in any reference work on
SGML:  the names given below are from ISO public entity sets, are
widely used, and are therefore recommended.</p>-->

<!--    <p>The <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element is used to provide detailed
information about the XML tags actually appearing within a text. It
may contain a simple list of elements used, with a count for each,
using the following special purpose elements:
<specList><specDesc key="tagUsage"/>
<specDesc key="rendition"/>
</specList></p>    <p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><tagsDecl>
<namespace name="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <tagUsage gi="text" occurs="1"/>
 <tagUsage gi="body" occurs="1"/>
 <tagUsage gi="p" occurs="42"/>
 <tagUsage gi="hi" occurs="6"/></namespace>
</tagsDecl></egXML>  This (imaginary) tags declaration would be appropriate for a
text containing twelve paragraphs in its body, within which six <gi>hi</gi>
elements have been marked. Note that if the <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element
is used, it must contain a <gi>tagUsage</gi> element for <emph>every</emph>
element tagged in the associated text element.</p>-->
            <p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is used to document the way in
which any standard referencing scheme built into the encoding works.
In its simplest form, it consists of prose description.</p>
            <p>Example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl><p>The N attribute on each DIV and DIV contains the
     canonical reference for each such division in the form
     XX.yyy where XX is the book number in roman numeral and
     yyy is the section number in arabic.</p></refsDecl></egXML></p>
            <p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element groups together definitions or
sources for any descriptive classification schemes used by other parts
of the header. At least one such scheme must be provided, encoded
using the following elements:
<specList><specDesc key="taxonomy"/><!--</gi></label><item>defines a typology used to classify texts either implicitly, by
means of a bibliographic citation, or explicitly by a structured
taxonomy.</item>--><specDesc key="bibl"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains a loosely-structured bibliographic citation of which
the sub-components may or may not be explicitly tagged. </item>--><specDesc key="category"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains an individual descriptive category, possibly nested
within a superordinate category, within a user-defined
taxonomy.</item>--><specDesc key="catDesc"/><!--</gi></label><item>describes some category within a taxonomy or text typology, in
the form of a brief prose description.</item>--></specList></p>
            <p>   In the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a
bibliographic reference, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classDecl><taxonomy xml:id="LCSH"><bibl>Library of Congress Subject Headings
          </bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></egXML></p>
            <p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special
purpose classification scheme, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><taxonomy xml:id="B"><bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl><category xml:id="B.A"><catDesc>Press Reportage</catDesc><category xml:id="B.A1"><catDesc>Daily</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A2"><catDesc>Sunday</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A3"><catDesc>National</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A4"><catDesc>Provincial</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A5"><catDesc>Political</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A6"><catDesc>Sports</catDesc></category></category><category xml:id="B.D"><catDesc>Religion</catDesc><category xml:id="B.D1"><catDesc>Books</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.D2"><catDesc>Periodicals and tracts</catDesc></category></category>
  ...
</taxonomy></egXML></p>
            <p>Linkage between a particular text and a category within such a
taxonomy is made by means of the <gi>catRef</gi> element within the
<gi>textClass</gi> element, as further described
       below.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The Profile Description</head>
          <p>The <gi>profileDesc</gi> element enables information
characterizing various descriptive aspects of a text to be recorded
within a single framework. It has three optional components:
<specList><specDesc key="creation"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains information
about the creation of a text.</item>--><specDesc key="langUsage"/><!--</gi></label><item>describes the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects,
etc., represented within a text.</item>--><specDesc key="textClass"/><!--</gi></label><item>groups information which describes the nature or topic of a
text in terms of a standard classification scheme, thesaurus,
etc.</item>--></specList></p>
          <p>The <gi>creation</gi> element is useful for documenting where a
work was created, even though it may not have been published or
recorded there.</p>
          <p>Example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><creation><date value="1992-08">August 1992</date><name type="place">Taos, New Mexico</name></creation></egXML></p>
          <p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> element is useful where a text contains many
different languages. It may contain <gi>language</gi> elements to
document each particular language used:
<specList><specDesc key="language"/></specList>
an example is needed.
</p>
          <p>The <gi>textClass</gi> element classifies a text by reference to
the system or systems defined by the <gi>classDecl</gi> element, and
contains one or more of the following elements:
<specList><specDesc key="keywords"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic or
nature of a text. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>scheme</att></label><item>identifies the controlled vocabulary within which the set of
keywords concerned is defined.</item>--><specDesc key="classCode"/><!--</gi></label><item>contains the classification code used for this text in some
standard classification system. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>scheme</att></label><item>identifies
the classification system or taxonomy in use.</item>--><specDesc key="catRef"/><!--</gi></label><item>specifies one or more defined categories within some taxonomy
or text typology. Attributes include:
<list type="gloss"><label><att>target</att></label><item>identifies
the categories concerned</item>--></specList>
</p>
          <p>The element <gi>keywords</gi> contains a list of keywords or
phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text. The attribute
<att>scheme</att> links these to the classification system
defined in
<gi>taxonomy</gi>.

          <head>The Revision Description</head>
          <p>The <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element provides a change log in which
each change made to a text may be recorded. The log may be recorded as
a sequence of <gi>change</gi> elements each of which contains
a brief description of thje change. The attributes <att>date</att> and
<att>who</att> may be used to identify when the change was carried out
