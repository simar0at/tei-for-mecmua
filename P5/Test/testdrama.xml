 <lb n="Ham.75"/><l part="Y">As thou art to thyself:  <lb n="Ham.76"/></l>
<l>Such was the very armour he had on  <lb n="Ham.77"/></l>
<l>When he the ambitious Norway combated;  <lb n="Ham.78"/></l>
<l>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,  <lb n="Ham.79"/></l>
<l>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.  <lb n="Ham.80"/></l>
<l part="Y">'Tis strange. </l>

 <lb n="Ham.83"/><l>In what particular thought to work I know not:  <lb n="Ham.84"/></l>
<l>But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,  <lb n="Ham.85"/></l>
<l>This bodes some strange eruption to our state. </l>
</sp>


<sp who="#Marcellus1"><speaker>Marcellus</speaker>
 <lb n="Ham.86"/><l>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,  <lb n="Ham.87"/></l>
<l>Why this same strict and most observant watch  <lb n="Ham.88"/></l>
<l>So nightly toils the subject of the land,  <lb n="Ham.89"/></l>
<l>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,  <lb n="Ham.90"/></l>
<l>And foreign mart for implements of war;  <lb n="Ham.91"/></l>
<l>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task  <lb n="Ham.92"/></l>
<l>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;  <lb n="Ham.93"/></l>
<l>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  <lb n="Ham.94"/></l>
<l>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:  <lb n="Ham.95"/></l>
<l part="I">Who is't that can inform me? </l>
</sp>


<sp who="#Horatio"><speaker>Horatio</speaker>
 <lb n="Ham.96"/><l part="F">That can I;  <lb n="Ham.97"/></l>
<l>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,  <lb n="Ham.98"/></l>
<l>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,  <lb n="Ham.99"/></l>
<l>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,  <lb n="Ham.100"/></l>
<l>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,  <lb n="Ham.101"/></l>
<l>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet  <lb n="Ham.102"/></l>
<l>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him  <lb n="Ham.103"/></l>
<l>Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,  <lb n="Ham.104"/></l>
<l>Well ratified by law and heraldry,  <lb n="Ham.105"/></l>
<l>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands  <lb n="Ham.106"/></l>
<l>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:  <lb n="Ham.107"/></l>
<l>Against the which, a moiety competent  <lb n="Ham.108"/></l>
<l>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd  <lb n="Ham.109"/></l>
<l>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,  <lb n="Ham.110"/></l>
<l>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same comart,  <lb n="Ham.111"/></l>
<l>And carriage of the article design'd,  <lb n="Ham.112"/></l>
<l>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,  <lb n="Ham.113"/></l>
<l>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  <lb n="Ham.114"/></l>
<l>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there  <lb n="Ham.115"/></l>
<l>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,  <lb n="Ham.116"/></l>
<l>For food and diet, to some enterprise  <lb n="Ham.117"/></l>
<l>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other  <lb n="Ham.118"/></l>
<l>As it doth well appear unto our state  <lb n="Ham.119"/></l>
<l>But to recover of us, by strong hand  <lb n="Ham.120"/></l>
<l>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands  <lb n="Ham.121"/></l>
<l>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,  <lb n="Ham.122"/></l>
<l>Is the main motive of our preparations,  <lb n="Ham.123"/></l>
<l>The source of this our watch and the chief head  <lb n="Ham.124"/></l>
<l>Of this post-haste and romage in the land. <lb n="Ham.125"/> </l>
</sp>


<sp who="#Barnardo"><speaker>Bernardo</speaker>
<l>I think it be no other but e'en so: </l>
<l>Well may it sort that this portentous figure </l>
<l>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king </l>
<l>That was and is the question of these wars. </l>
</sp>


<sp who="#Horatio"><speaker>Horatio</speaker>
<l>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. </l>
<l>In the most high and palmy state of Rome, </l>
<l>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, </l>
<l>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead </l>
<l>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: </l>
<l>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, </l>
<l>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star </l>
<l>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands </l>
<l>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: </l>
<l>And even the like precurse of feared events, </l>
<l>As harbingers preceding still the fates </l>
<l>And prologue to the omen coming on. </l>
<l>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated </l>
<l>Unto our climatures and countrymen.  <lb n="Ham.126"/></l>
<l>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<stage type="entrance">Re-enter Ghost.</stage>
  <lb n="Ham.127"/></l>
<l>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!  <lb n="Ham.128"/></l>
<l>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,  <lb n="Ham.129"/></l>
<l part="Y">Speak to me: </l>
<l>If there be any good thing to be done,  <lb n="Ham.130"/></l>
<l>That may to thee do ease and grace to me, </l>
<l part="Y">Speak to me:<stage type="mix">Cock crows.</stage>
  <lb n="Ham.131"/></l>
<l>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,  <lb n="Ham.132"/></l>
<l>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, </l>
<l part="Y">O, speak!  <lb n="Ham.133"/></l>
<l>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life  <lb n="Ham.134"/></l>
<l>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,  <lb n="Ham.135"/></l>
<l>For which they say, your spirits oft walk in death,  <lb n="Ham.136"/></l>
<l>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. </l>

<l>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,  <lb n="Ham.145"/></l>

<l>In filial obligation for some term  <lb n="Ham.274"/></l>

<l>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,  <lb n="Ham.278"/></l>
<l>A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,  <lb n="Ham.279"/></l>

<l>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone  <lb n="Ham.475"/></l>

<l>The inward service of the mind and soul  <lb n="Ham.477"/></l>

<l>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch  <lb n="Ham.479"/></l>
<l>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,  <lb n="Ham.480"/></l>
<l>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;  <lb n="Ham.481"/></l>
<l>For he himself is subject to his birth:  <lb n="Ham.482"/></l>
<l>He may not, as unvalued persons do,  <lb n="Ham.483"/></l>
<l>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends  <lb n="Ham.484"/></l>
<l>The safety and health of this whole state;  <lb n="Ham.485"/></l>
<l>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed  <lb n="Ham.486"/></l>
<l>Unto the voice and yielding of that body  <lb n="Ham.487"/></l>
<l>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,  <lb n="Ham.488"/></l>
<l>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it  <lb n="Ham.489"/></l>
<l>As he in his particular act and place  <lb n="Ham.490"/></l>
<l>May give his saying deed; which is no further  <lb n="Ham.491"/></l>
<l>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.  <lb n="Ham.492"/></l>
<l>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,  <lb n="Ham.493"/></l>
<l>If with too credent ear you list his songs,  <lb n="Ham.494"/></l>
<l>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open  <lb n="Ham.495"/></l>

<l>Out of the shot and danger of desire.  <lb n="Ham.499"/></l>

<l>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:  <lb n="Ham.501"/></l>
<l>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:  <lb n="Ham.502"/></l>
<l>The canker galls the infants of the spring,  <lb n="Ham.503"/></l>
<l>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,  <lb n="Ham.504"/></l>
<l>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth  <lb n="Ham.505"/></l>
<l>Contagious blastments are most imminent.  <lb n="Ham.506"/></l>

<l>And these few precepts in thy memory  <lb n="Ham.524"/></l>
<l>Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,  <lb n="Ham.525"/></l>
<l>Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.  <lb n="Ham.526"/></l>
<l>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.  <lb n="Ham.527"/></l>
<l>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,  <lb n="Ham.528"/></l>
<l>Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;  <lb n="Ham.529"/></l>
<l>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  <lb n="Ham.530"/></l>
<l>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged courage. Beware  <lb n="Ham.531"/></l>
<l>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,  <lb n="Ham.532"/></l>
<l>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.  <lb n="Ham.533"/></l>
<l>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;  <lb n="Ham.534"/></l>
<l>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.  <lb n="Ham.535"/></l>
<l>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  <lb n="Ham.536"/></l>
<l>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;  <lb n="Ham.537"/></l>
<l>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,  <lb n="Ham.538"/></l>
<l>And they in France of the best rank and station  <lb n="Ham.539"/></l>
<l>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.  <lb n="Ham.540"/></l>
<l>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;  <lb n="Ham.541"/></l>
<l>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,  <lb n="Ham.542"/></l>
<l>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.  <lb n="Ham.543"/></l>
<l>This above all: to thine own self be true,  <lb n="Ham.544"/></l>
<l>And it must follow, as the night the day,  <lb n="Ham.545"/></l>
<l>Thou canst not then be false to any man.  <lb n="Ham.546"/></l>

<l>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn  <lb n="Ham.1734"/></l>
<l>No traveller returns, puzzles the will  <lb n="Ham.1735"/></l>

<l>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,  <lb n="Ham.2033"/></l>
<l>So far from cheer and from your former state,  <lb n="Ham.2034"/></l>
<l>That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,  <lb n="Ham.2035"/></l>
<l>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:  <lb n="Ham.2036"/></l>
<l>For women's fear and love hold quantity;  <lb n="Ham.2037"/></l>
<l>In neither aught, or in extremity.  <lb n="Ham.2038"/></l>
<l>Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;  <lb n="Ham.2039"/></l>
<l>And as my love is sized, my fear is so: </l>

</sp>


<sp who="#ham-p.-king."><speaker>Player King</speaker>
 <lb n="Ham.2054"/><l>I do believe you think what now you speak;  <lb n="Ham.2055"/></l>
<l>But what we do determine oft we break.  <lb n="Ham.2056"/></l>
<l>Purpose is but the slave to memory,  <lb n="Ham.2057"/></l>
<l>Of violent birth, but poor validity:  <lb n="Ham.2058"/></l>
<l>Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;  <lb n="Ham.2059"/></l>
<l>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.  <lb n="Ham.2060"/></l>
<l>Most necessary 'tis that we forget  <lb n="Ham.2061"/></l>
<l>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:  <lb n="Ham.2062"/></l>
<l>What to ourselves in passion we propose,  <lb n="Ham.2063"/></l>
<l>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.  <lb n="Ham.2064"/></l>
<l>The violence of either grief or joy  <lb n="Ham.2065"/></l>
<l>Their own enactures with themselves destroy:  <lb n="Ham.2066"/></l>
<l>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;  <lb n="Ham.2067"/></l>
<l>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.  <lb n="Ham.2068"/></l>
<l>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange  <lb n="Ham.2069"/></l>
<l>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;  <lb n="Ham.2070"/></l>
<l>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,  <lb n="Ham.2071"/></l>
<l>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.  <lb n="Ham.2072"/></l>
<l>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;  <lb n="Ham.2073"/></l>
<l>The poor advanced makes friends of enemies,  <lb n="Ham.2074"/></l>
<l>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;  <lb n="Ham.2075"/></l>
<l>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,  <lb n="Ham.2076"/></l>
<l>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,  <lb n="Ham.2077"/></l>
<l>Directly seasons him his enemy.  <lb n="Ham.2078"/></l>
<l>But, orderly to end where I begun,  <lb n="Ham.2079"/></l>
<l>Our wills and fates do so contrary run  <lb n="Ham.2080"/></l>
<l>That our devices still are overthrown;  <lb n="Ham.2081"/></l>
<l>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:  <lb n="Ham.2082"/></l>
<l>So think thou wilt no second husband wed;  <lb n="Ham.2083"/></l>
<l>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. </l>
