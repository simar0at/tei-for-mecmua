              </opener>
              <p>AN English gentleman, of large fortune, has
	  for some time made private, though honourable
	  proposals to your daughter Olivia. They love
	  each other tenderly, and I find she has consented,
	  without letting any of the family know, to crown
	  his addresses. As such good offers don't come
	  every day, your own good sense, his large fortune,
	  and family considerations, will induce you to for∣give
	  her.</p>
              <closer>
                <signed>Yours ever,
	  RACHAEL CROAKER.</signed>

          <p>There is at least a mathematical relationship, or perhaps I
	ought rather to have said a metaphysical relationship between
	them.  Sir Isaac Newton has observed, that the breadths of the
	seven primary colours in the Sun's image refracted by a prism
	are proportional to the seven musical notes of the gamut, or
	to the intervals of the eight sounds contained in an octave,
	that is, proportional to the following numbers:</p>

          <p>All the Women of our Stage have made a Party against me
          upon the Account of this Accident in the <hi>Libertine,</hi>
          and say, that ano∣ther such Instance of Chastity might ruin
          them; for which Reason, and because I have no Money to make
          an Interest with Mr. <hi>Lillie,</hi> t'other Gentleman's
          Agent, I shall be undone, unless your Honour will pity my
          Case.</p>

            <l>So says our bard!—then who would break a rule,</l>
