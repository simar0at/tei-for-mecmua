Dear Sebastian,

    I have heard back from William Graves and he is very happy for the 
images to be made for the TEI Guidelines.  So, no problems.

All best wishes,
John

Dear Sebastian,

    The St John's Robert Graves Trust has no objection to this, but I 
should like as a matter of courtesy to clear it with William Graves, 
Robert Graves' executor.  I am e-mailing him at once.

All best wishes,
John
