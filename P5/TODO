1. table of contents. DONE 2007/11/17

2. number front matter sections in roman. DONE 2007/11/17

3. The bookmarks give no indication that the appendices are
appendices. DONE 2007/11/17

4. Hyperlinks to a section now typically jump to a location just below
the section title, which I find disorienting. Would it be possible to
jump to just before the title?

5. a list of all attributes. 

6. hyperlink the element names in the text to appendix C.  DONE 2007/11/17.

7. index.   Partly done 2007/11/17.

8. give examples link to bibl eg "O what a tangled web we weave" [45]

9. Format appendices using list technology. DONE 2007/11/26.

10. Appendix B - is it useful to have the datatype in a box, rather
    than simply (keeping the special font for
    'data.temporal.iso'). DONE 2007/11/26

11. Appendix C - Where the may-contain list crosses a page boundary,
   this becomes a hyperlink: '1.0. Last updated on 28th October
   2007. 620'.

12. Appendix E clicking reference to Klinkenborg and Cahoon in E.1
    no. 12 has no effect. FIXED 2007/11/30.

13. I would expect journal titles (such as Computers and the
    Humanities) in E.2 to be in italics.  FIXED 2007/11/30. 

14. in E.3.1: 'van derAdriaan Weel'. DONE 2007/11/30.

15. Outdent subsection headings, especially in reference docs?  In the
    reference doc, repeating the name of the thing being documented looks
    silly. either lose the second occurrence, or (my preference) lose the
    first one and embolden the second one.

16. sansreflist right indent. DONE 2007/11/30.

17. atttribute classes, why in []? - expand with list of attribute
    names. DONE 2007/11/30.

18. @ before attribute name in HTML in elementSpec (cf hand).  DONE 2007/11/30

19. add @ before attname in att classes (and elements). DONE 2007/11/30

20. bit more linespacing in examples? DONE 2007/11/30.

21. model classes(eg model.phrase) show Members as tree diagrams?

22.  the running titles in the appendices contain things like
    'C.0. <biblStruct>'. FIXED 2007/11/30

23. the declaration of the bibl element in the
    appendix runs out of the box (like the place element) 

24. I wouldn't expect element names to be hyphenated? But see
    'signatures' under element catchwords, p. 663, and
    elsewhere. FIXED 2007/11/30.

25. there are French glosses where English has <gloss/>

26. documentation generated in Roma does not show language.

27. The toc goes down too deep and the roman numbers are not uniformly
    right aligned

28. Something weird happened on page lxvii (probably the tagging is at
    fault though it looks ok in the HTML version)

29. Probably the background shading for the examples should be
    different (lighter) from that used for the description line. Or remove
    it. Or replace it with the same kind of box as is used for the
    declaration?

30. In the bibliog, all the references which include a URL starting
    dx.doi.org have come out looking werry strange (tho other URLs are OK)

31. Maybe if the bibliog were set ragged right the spacing would be better?

32. the Declaration for a data macro has an unhealthy mixture of fonts
    and no box round it (contrast e,.g. data.xTruthValue with the
    immediately following macro.limitedContent)
