1. table of contents. Done 2007/11/17

2. number front matter sections in roman. Done 2007/11/17

3. The bookmarks give no indication that the appendices are
appendices. Done 2007/11/17

4. Hyperlinks to a section now typically jump to a location just below
the section title, which I find disorienting. Would it be possible to
jump to just before the title?

5. a list of all attributes. 

6. hyperlink the element names in the text to appendix C.  Done 2007/11/17.

7. index.   Parly done 2007/11/17.

8. give examples link to bibl "O what a tangled web we weave"    [45] 

9. Format appendices using list technology. Done 2007/11/26.

10. Appendix B - is it useful to have the datatype in a box, rather
    than simply (keeping the special font for
    'data.temporal.iso'). Done 2007/11/26

11. Appendix C - Where the may-contain list crosses a page boundary,
   this becomes a hyperlink: '1.0. Last updated on 28th October
   2007. 620'

12. Appendix E clicking reference to Klinkenborg and Cahoon in E.1
    no. 12 has no effect

13. I would expect journal titles (such as Computers and the
    Humanities) in E.2 to be in italics

14. in E.3.1: 'van derAdriaan Weel'

15. Outdent subsections

16. sansreflist right indent

17. atttribute classes, why in []? expand with list of attribute
    names?

18. no @ before attribute name in HTML in elementSpec (cf hand). why?

19. add @ before attname in att classes (and elements)

20. bit more linespacing in examples?

21. eg model.phrase show Members as tree diagrams

22.  the running titles in the appendices contain things like
    'C.0. <biblStruct>' 

23. the declaration of the bibl element in the
    appendix runs out of the box (like the place element) 

24. I wouldn't expect element names to be hyphenated? But see
     'signatures' under element catchwords, p. 663, and elsewhere

25. there are French glosses where English has <gloss/>

26. documentation generated in Roma does not show language
