Dear TEI users, <lb/>

After more than 6 years of, at times quite intensive, development, it is
with great pleasure that I announce the release of version 1.0 of P5, the
latest and greatest version of the Guidelines of the Text Encoding
Initiative, which <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Membership/Meetings/2007/launch.pdf">officially happened Nov. 2 2007 at the TEI Members Meeting in
Maryland</ref>.  You will find the new version online at
http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html; a PDF and
even printed books are expected to appear in due time.
</p>

<p>
The main development work has been carried out by the TEI Technical Council
and the Editors Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman.  I would like to take this
opportunity to warmly thank all previous members of the Council but also
especially the current members, who shared quite a bit of the work, which
magically increased as the release date was approaching:
</p>

<p>
David Birnbaum, Tone Merete Bruvik, Arianna Ciula, James Cummings, Matthew
Driscoll, Daniel O'Donnel, Dot Porter, Sebastian Rahtz Laurent Romary, Conal
Tuohy, John Walsh.

Chair, TEI Technical Council
