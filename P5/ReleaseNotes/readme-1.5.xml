This release contains only a few new features and significant
changes:


* A new element called <gi>surplus</gi> has been added to the
Transcription module, originally proposed by SF ticket 2242434 
* Content models of <gi>char</gi> and <gi>glyph</gi> were
changed to require <gi>figure</gi> rather than any model./graphicLike
element  (2812295)
* An attribute <att>role</att> is now provided by the att.naming
class making it possible to distinguish the functions of the people
assopciated with particular name in a source without the trouble of
defining <gi>person</gi> elements for them (1954920)
* Following changes made to permit better documentation of
constraints within an ODD, the element  <gi>valList</gi> was changed
from being a possible child of <gi>content</gi>  to being a sibling of
it. 

Various minor clarifications and corrections were made to the wording of
the Guidelines in response to Sourceforge tickets (e.g. 2881723, 2883950, 2813423 2877747, 2761884, 2863337,
2750513, 2820540, 2820541)

translations and examples continued, with a large number of changes
made in July, September, and November.
