      <p>This release contains the following substantive changes
<list>
<item>The chapter on
      Certainty and Responsibility has been revised extensively,
      introducing a new element (<gi>precision</gi>) for markup of
      numerical precision, and an entirely new mechanism for
      defining the scope of uncertainty, based on XSLT match
      expressions. </item>
<item>A new element <gi>pc</gi> (punctuation character) has been added to the Analysis and
Interpretation module, permitting the explicit markup of
punctuation. The discussion of punctuation markup in the Core elements
chapter was substantially revised (2372570). </item>
<item>New elements <gi>constraintSpec</gi> and <gi>constraint</gi>
were introduced to the Tag Documentation module as a means of formally
documenting  constraints on an element's content or usage additional to
those of its content model (1933198). </item>
<item>A new generic <gi>dim</gi> element and associated class were
added to support all kinds of measurements; content model of
<gi>dimensions</gi> was relaxed to allow any mixture of dimensional
specifications, but constrained to forbid repetitions (2594174). </item>
</list></p>

<p>Over this period, a number of  pervasive editorial changes were made: 
<list>
<item>All exemples have been given an explicit language code,
wherever possible, and some missing bibliographic references were added. </item>
<item>Some further changes were made to extend support for Korean and Japanese.
</item>
<item>The G8 (AFNOR) group added a very large number of  French translations
to the reference documentation. </item>
</list> </p>


<p>Other significant changes made are listed briefly below in date order. Where 
further discussion of the change is available in the SF bug tracker,
the ticket number is indicated in parentheses.
