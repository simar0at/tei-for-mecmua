      <p> This version of the TEI introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by
        the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a
        consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community, using the SourceForge
        tracking system. If you find something you think needs to change in the TEI Guidelines,
        schemas, tools, or website, please submit a feature request or bug ticket at <ref
          target="http://tei.sf.net/">http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for consideration.</p>

      <p>Some of the highlights of the TEI P5 2.4.0 release include:
        <list>
          <item>A new simplified index/table-of-contents page for the web version of the Guidelines.</item>
          <item>Hundreds of typos fixed, prose made clearer, and formatting issues solved</item>
          <item>Element <gi>sex</gi> and attributes <att>value</att> and <att>sex</att> changed to allow more inclusive values (per <ref target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/425/">FR 425</ref>)</item>
          <item>Usage of <gi>app</gi> with no <gi>lem</gi> or just
	  <gi>note</gi> explained and illustrated (per <ref
	  target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/366/">BUG
	  366</ref>)</item>
	  <item>A number of changes to loosen content models, mostly
	  driven by experience of TCP EEBO project:
	  <list>
	    <item>allow a <gi>teiCorpus</gi> to have <gi>facsimile</gi> and <gi>sourceDoc</gi> children, like <gi>TEI</gi> (FR 456)</item>
	    <item>loosen content model of <gi>cell</gi> to make it the same as <gi>p</gi> (FR 455)</item>
	    <item>expand content model of <gi>figure</gi> to allow more components (FR 454)</item>
	    <item>allow <gi>foreign</gi> to contain <gi>q</gi> (FR 442)</item>
	    <item>allow <gi>epigraph</gi>  at end of <gi>front</gi> (FR 434)</item>
	  </list>
	  </item>
	  <item>Implementation of a new notation for deprecated
	  elements and attributes, which now have a <q>valid until</q>
	  date recorded</item>
          <item><!-- add items and include <ref> to element reference page and/or FR --> </item>
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>Since the last P5
      release, several releases have also been made to the family of XSL stylesheets maintained for the TEI,
      largely fixing bugs in conversion to ePub, and to/from Word docx
      format.</p>
<p>A new translation of the TEI Lite tutorial into French has been
completed, and is now included in the Exemplars directory. The French
translations for a number of element descriptions were corrected at
the same time. Unlike earlier versions, this
version of the TEI Lite tutorial now uses only French language examples. </p>
