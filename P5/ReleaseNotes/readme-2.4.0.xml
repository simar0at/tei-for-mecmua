      <p>This version of the TEI introduces new features and resolves
      a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the
      majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
      feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the
      SourceForge tracking system. If you find something you think
      needs to change in the TEI Guidelines, schemas, tools, or
      website, please submit a feature request or bug ticket at <ref
      target="http://tei.sf.net/">http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for
      consideration. Lists of <ref
      target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/search/?q=status%3Aclosed-wont-fix+or+status%3Aclosed-rejected+or+status%3Aclosed-out-of-date+or+status%3Aclosed-accepted+or+status%3Aclosed-works-for-me+or+status%3Aclosed+or+status%3Aclosed-duplicate+or+status%3Aclosed-invalid+or+status%3Aclosed-fixed"
      >closed bugs</ref> and <ref
      target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/search/?q=status%3Aclosed-wont-fix+or+status%3Aclosed-later+or+status%3Aclosed-rejected+or+status%3Aclosed-out-of-date+or+status%3Aclosed-accepted+or+status%3Aclosed-remind+or+status%3Aclosed+or+status%3Aclosed-duplicate+or+status%3Aclosed-invalid+or+status%3Aclosed-fixed"
      >closed feature requests</ref> are available on the site. The
      software provided by SourceForge has changed and some old URLs
      for tickets may eventually break (they currently forward). This
      new system gives much more readable URLs (e.g.
      http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/445/) and so Council has
      stopped using the purl URLs (e.g.
      http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3572502) created as shortcuts to
      SourceForge's previously long URLs. As part of this software
      change users who check out a copy of the TEI-C Subversion
      repository must update its location to that provided at <ref
      target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/code/"
      >http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/code/</ref>.</p>

      <p>Since the last P5 release, several releases have also been
      made to the family of XSL stylesheets maintained for the TEI,
      largely fixing bugs in conversion to ePub, and to or from Word
      docx format.</p>
      <p>A new translation of the TEI Lite tutorial into French has
      been completed, and is now included in the Exemplars directory.
      The French translations for a number of element descriptions
      were corrected at the same time. Unlike earlier versions, this
      version of the TEI Lite tutorial now uses only French language
      examples.</p>
