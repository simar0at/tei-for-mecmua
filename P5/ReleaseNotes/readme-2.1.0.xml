    <body>
      <p>This is a maintenance release of the P5 Guidelines, which
      does however introduce some changes in existing content
      models.</p>
<p>The majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community, using the
Sourceforge tracking system. The Council has also launched an
initiative to make some systematic improvements in the prose of the
Guidelines, notably in normalising some spelling and punctuation
variations. </p>
<p> Since the last release (14 February 2012), the Council has closed
xxx tickets in the sourceforge tracking system, which should be
consulted for details of the specific changes implemented and
proposed. Ticket numbers are also referenced in the Change Log, as
usual.</p>
<div><head>Schema Changes</head>
<p>These changes should not affect existing documents,
but do result in changes to the generated schemas.
      
<list type="ordered">
<item>The content models of <gi>availability</gi>,
<gi>postscript</gi>, <gi>spGrp</gi>, and <gi>surface</gi>, have been
modified to remove some inappropriate restrictions ()</item>
<item>Additional schematron constraints have been implemented for
several elements, notably for <gi>attDef</gi>, <gi>delSpan</gi> and
other members of the <ident>att.spanning</ident> class.</item>
<item>A new class <ident>att.datcat</ident> has been introduced to
permit the use of ISO Standard Data Category Registry values where
appropriate (3432520)</item>
<item>The attribute <att>version</att> has been renamed
<att>versionDate</att> to clarify its function (3393781)</item>
<item>A new class <ident type="class">att.witnessed</ident> was
introduced to ensure that only appropriate elements carry the
<att>wit</att> attribute (3496951)</item>
<item>A new attribute <att>targetLang</att> was added to the
<ident>att.pointing</ident> class to specify the
language of the content of an element being pointed to  (3288293)</item>
<item>The <gi>idno</gi> element may now self-nest (3441658)</item>
<!--
SCHEMA CHANGES
	change to <surface>	
	adjust surface to use labelLike instead of glossLike, and that allows for global elements to be interleaved
	rewrite content model to be deterministic,  at the cost of allowing glossLike and graphicLike to interleave at the start of <surface>
	relax postscript content model 
	rewrite content model of postscript to allow model.global anywhere; examples in Test/testecco.xml

	add constraint on attDef that it must have a datatype or a closed valList; update ISO schematron code

att.datcat:
	members of att.datcat (practically, only @valueDatcat relevant here)
	member of att.datcat
	making fs and att.lexicographic members of att.datcat; removing gram from it
	make att.datcat work minimally
	make class declaration valid TEI
	set up att.datcat, dont just declare it
	use right name of attribute class, att.datcat
	an imperfect fix to the placement of the egXML
	attempting to install att.datcat cf, ticket 3432520
	Not functional yet, cf. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3432520&group_id=106328&atid=644065

	changing the version attribute from att.translatable into versionDate. cf Sourceforge  tei-Bugs-3393781
	clarify use of @version on the TEI element, per 3393781

	A /trunk/P5/Source/Specs/att.witnessed.xml
	add the poxy source file
	Remove @wit from rdgGrp per bug 3496951

	Implementing @refLang per ID: 3288293; not sure if the schematron check is optimal

	Action item from Ann Arbor meeting arising out of ticket 3439587.

	adjust model to allow multiple graphic in table properly with page breaks. http://purl.org/tei/fr/3305016

	allow <trailer> to have type/subtype attributes, per Council meeting 2012-04-16 (noted that trailer is repeatable, so distinguishing between occurences with @type is desirable)

	permit multiple heads at start of a spGrp for consistency with div etc.

	implement fr 3441658 permitting nested <idno> elements

	change content model of availability to reference model.pLike and model.availabilityPart specifically; remove p as member of model.availabilityPart; add test to test suite implementing fr 3449887

</p></div>
<div><head>Textual Changes</head>
<p>A large number of minor enhancements of various kinds were
implementing, ranging from correction of typos and normalisation of
punctuation, to rewording of phrases considered needlessly
obscure. In addition, a number of systematic checks and enhancements
were carried out :
<list>
<item>explicit usage examples are being added for all attributes
specified, to complement those already provided for all elements; </item>
<item>several passages reported as misleading or ambiguous in
sourceforge tickets were reworded or clarified; </item>
<item>some cosmetic changes were made to the formatting of the PDF and HTML
versions of the Guidelines, notably to ensure that only  open source
fonts are used throughout; </item>
<item>a large number of typos were corrected,  many of them reported by
a few careful proofreaders from the TEI Community (to whom our
thanks!) </item>
</list>
</p>

<!--

ADD EXAMPLES FOR ALL ATTRIBUTEs
	add examples to node.xml
	add @xml:lang example to att.global.xml
	add @type example to att.typed.xml
	add @key example to att.canonical.xml
	add bi-lingual corresp example to att.global.linking.xml
	Examples for @aloud and @direct on <said> (see
	http://purl.org/TEI/BUGS/3520704), and a bibliography addition for
	one of them.
	Adding @xml:lang to <egXML> for examples, and moving explanatory
	text from <egXML up to <exemplum>.
	added @xml:lang on egXML (Latin)
	Redoing formatting for examples of @corresp and @break.
	Added an example for @break (http://purl.org/TEI/BUGS/3520704), and also linked att.breaking spec to #CORS5; it was previously linked to Attribute Classes, which doesn't mention it, and isn't really relevant.
	Added an example for @corresp (see http://purl.org/TEI/BUGS/3520704).
	added examples of author IDs per FR 2493417
	corrected <ptr>s in <listRef>
	add example of @prefix on moduleRef/@url
	note an example of same name in two namespaces
	Made it clear that @targetLang is not one of the global attributes, but I'm having some doubts as to whether it should appear here at all; but it IS tempting to mention it here to prevent the abuse of @xml:lang, and I hope that this is OK as the rationale.
	Replacing bad example in att.scoping per http://purl.org/TEI/BUGS/3518818
	it's not classes that are 'mostly' adjectival but parts of their
	names, and besides this information is not precise and in general
	simply not relevant

	M /trunk/P5/Source/Guidelines/en/AI-AnalyticMechanisms.xml
	M /trunk/P5/Source/Guidelines/en/ND-NamesDates.xml

	Acting on http://purl.org/TEI/BUGS/3500088, and adding an explanation and example showing how to declare and use more than one <metDecl> element in the same document.
	(Incomplete <lg>s won't do, even in <egXML>s.)
	correct capitalisation in node.xml
	Reworded explanation of key added at revision 10374 per Lou's suggestion
	very slightly more rational : /trunk/P5/Source/Specs/occupation.xml
	Following discussion on the Council list, made a slight change to the <desc> of @versionDate and added some clarification in <remarks>.
	FR 3437509: recommend use of tag URIs instead of @key	
	corrected havdalah example per bug 3475748
	Added <listRef><ptr target="#WD"/></listRef> to the end of the g.xml spec to provide a link to the relevant chapter. No idea why this was missing.

	addition of full stop to the sentence in remarks of floatingText spec	
	clarify alternative lacunaEnd example (#3496998)
	clarify conformance or not of non-TEI attributes
	remove space from "ice cream"; briefly consider adding biblio cit
	for source but decided it wd be too silly
	redo the formula examples
	tweak wording re presence of quotation marks per bug 3505300
	
Make  <schemaSpec> available explicitly within <encodingDesc> and document
	usage in the HD chapter, per Council decision in Michigan on ticket http://purl.org/TEI/FR/1650195.
	M /trunk/P5/Source/Specs/lg.xmlmake prose fit the spec, which allows for only one line inside an lg somewhere

TYPOGRAPHIC IMPROVEMENMTS

	avoid empty <ul> in example web pages
	when listing examples, show those from the home chapter first
	avoid headers and footers on blank pages, as per SF bug report 3475600

<div><head>Environmental Changes</head>
<p>The production of new releases of TEI P5 is now almost entirely automated, with
all modifications continuously tested using a pair of
Jenkins continuous integration servers. This has
necessitated development and maintenance of a suite of scripts which
have seen a large number of changes since the Council decided to
ensure that a TEI P5 Release could be tested and delivered by any
Council member. Full details of the current procedure for doing this are
now provided in working document TCW20,  which has been considerably
enhanced during this period. </p>
