      <p>This version of the TEI is an maintenance release to solve
      issues which were found after the release of 2.4.0.  These
      related primarily to the formatting and content of the TEI Lite
      documentation in English and French.</p>
     
      <p>The opportunity
      has been taken to correct an omission made when the element
      <gi>precision</gi> was introduced in 2099, explained on the
      <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/585/">bug
      report</ref>. This gives the element attributes from the
      <code>att.ranging</code>
      class.     Because this changes the schema, the release goes
      from 2.4.* to 2.5.*.</p>
