<p>This release introduces significant additional features to the way
in which the ODD system for TEI customization may be expressed. The
new features introduced allow a customization to be expressed by
inclusion (specifying only the elements it requires) rather than by
exclusion (specifying the elements which it does not require). Support
for this entailed definition of new attributes for <gi>moduleRef</gi>,
and new elements <gi>elementRef</gi>, <gi>macroref</gi> and
<gi>classRef</gi> as well as some revision to the prose of the
relevant Guidelines chapters. Some clarification of the way the
odd-to-odd transformation process works, for example when generating
pattern prefixes for RelaxNG was also necessary. The new features
greatly simplify the process of generating user specific
customisations, while retaining all the existing behaviours. In
addition, the test suite was revised and extended to check that the
new facilities worked as intended, and work begun on tutorial material
for the revised system which will be the subject of a Workshop to be
taught at the 2010 General Meeting.
</p>

<p>As usual, several minor clarifications and corrections were made to
the wording of the Guidelines in response to Sourceforge tickets (e.g.
3025031 3025032 3025017 2989088 2942469 2965680 2981703 2982056 ) and discussion on Council and TEI-L
mailing lists. </p>

<p>The work of the AFNOR group providing and correcting French
translations and examples continued; in particular during May and June
work on a new suite of French language examples was undertaken.</p>

	Changed paths:

	add <listRef>; make content optional ala RELAX NG content (so that target= can be used instead), and add Schematron rule to ensure one or the other is present; fix Schematron constraint so that formal test does what prose content of <report> said: ensure that both target= and child are not present, per SF FR 2728061.
