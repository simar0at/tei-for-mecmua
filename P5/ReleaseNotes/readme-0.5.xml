      <p>Changes since the last packaged release (0.4.1, July
	2006) are listed briefly below (please refer to the ChangeLog in
	directory ReleaseNotes at the Sourceforge archive for a full list).
Following the major architectural changes introduced in the
previous release, this release has focussed on improving the prose of
several chapters, on extending the suite of available examples and
templates, and on a number of minor corrections and enhancements
deriving from Source Forge feature requests.</p>
<list>
<item>Work on rationalising and making consistent the representation of
dates on various attributes began, but is not yet complete. Elements
<gi>dateRange</gi> and <gi>timeRange</gi> have been removed. </item>
<item>Changes in the way that model class references are processed by the
ODD processor were implemented; we believe these changes enable us to
avoid prolems of inter-module dependency as well as enhancing the
range of facilities in the ODD language.</item>
<item>At Council's request the XML source files have been given longer
English names.</item>
<item>The draft chapter on linking and segmentation was revised for
readability and one of its longer  examples was enhanced to demonstrate
use of SVG graphics within a TEI document.</item>
<item>A first draft of a revision of the chapter on non-hierarchic markup
was included.</item>
<item>Several new exemplars and templates were added, complementing a
major revision of the Roma schema generation tool. Each example now
includes a template. Examples of the use of SVG, XInclude, and MathML have
been added. </item>
<item>Spanish language translations for element descriptions etc. were
added.</item>
<item>The process of replacing explicit element or attribute references
with class references continued in several content models and element
declarations.</item>
<item>The P5 colophon was updated. </item>
<item>A new <gi>age</gi> element was added.</item>
