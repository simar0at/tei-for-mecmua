      <p>This release has the usual set of typo fixes to the reference
      part of the Guidelines, some changes to the specs, many changes
      to build tools, and associated updates to the processing
      stylesheets.  Notable changes (in decreasing order of visibility
      to the end user) are:
      <list type="ordered">
	<item>The <gi>egXML</gi> element has been given an attribute
	<att>valid</att> which can have the values true, false and
	feasible. This indicates whether the example is supposed to be valid or
	not. If it is marked feasible, this means it could be transformed into
	a valid document by inserting any number of valid attributes and child
	elements anywhere within it; it is valid against a version of the
	schema concerned in which every data, list, element, or attribute
	element has been made optional. The web version of the Guidelines will
	distinguish these cases by use of different background colours. This
	allows us to show examples which are only skeleton TEI documents, rather
	than self-contained valid fragments.</item>
	
	<item>All elements now have at least one example, and all the examples
	have been checked for validity or feasibility again (a previous error
	in the process had allowed some invalid ones through).</item>
	
	<item>All elements have been changed to make them explicit members of 
	the <ident>att.global</ident> attribute class, rather than having this
	done by special-case processing during the build
	procedure. This means that any ODD which defines elements in
	the TEI namespace will have to explicitly add
	<ident>att.global</ident> to them.</item>
	
	<item>The Guidelines are now available in ePub and Kindle formats.</item>
      </list>
