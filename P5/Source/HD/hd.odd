<div1 xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="Chapter" xml:id="HD" n="5"><head>The TEI Header</head>
<p>This chapter addresses the problems of describing an encoded work so
that the text itself, its source, its encoding, and its revisions are
all thoroughly documented.  Such documentation is equally necessary for
scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for
cataloguers in libraries and archives.  Together these descriptions and
declarations provide an electronic analogue to the title page attached
to a printed work.  They also constitute an equivalent for the content
of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying
electronic data sets.</p>
<p>Every TEI-conformant text must carry such a set of descriptions,
prefixed to it and encoded as described in this chapter.  The set is
known as the <term>TEI header</term>, tagged <gi>teiHeader</gi>,
and it has four major parts:

<list type="bullets">
<item>a <term>file description</term>, tagged <gi>fileDesc</gi>,
containing a full bibliographical description of the computer file
itself, from which a user of the text could derive a proper
bibliographic citation, or which a librarian or archivist could use in
creating a catalogue entry recording its presence within a library or
archive.  The term <term>computer file</term> here is to be understood
as referring to the whole entity or document described by the header, 
even when this is stored in several distinct operating system files.
The file description also includes information about the
source or sources from which the electronic document was derived.  The TEI
elements used to encode a file description are described in section <ptr target="#HD2"/>
 below.
</item>
<item>an <term>encoding description</term>, tagged <gi>encodingDesc</gi>,
which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its
source or sources.  It allows for detailed description of whether (or
how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder
resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis
were applied, and similar matters. The TEI elements used to encode the
encoding description are described in section <ptr target="#HD5"/> below.
</item>
<item>a <term>text profile</term>, tagged <gi>profileDesc</gi>,
containing classificatory and contextual information about the text,
such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the
individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth.
Such a text profile is of particular use in highly structured composite
texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly
desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform
retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin.  The
text profile may however be of use in any form of automatic text
processing.  The TEI elements used to encode the profile description
are described in section <ptr target="#HD4"/> below.
</item>
<item>a <term>revision history</term>, tagged <gi>revisionDesc</gi>,
which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the
development of the electronic text.  The revision history is important
for <term>version control</term> and for resolving questions about the
history of a file.  The TEI elements used to encode the revision
description are described in section <ptr target="#HD6"/> below.</item></list>
</p>
<p>A TEI header can be a very large and complex object, or it may be a
very simple one.  Some application areas (for example, the construction
of language corpora and the transcription of spoken texts) will require
more specialized and detailed information than others.  The present
proposals therefore define both a <term>core</term> set of elements,
(all of which may be used without formality in any TEI header) and
<term>additional tagsets</term>, which may be invoked as extensions as
needed.  For more details of this extension mechanism, see chapter <ptr target="#STBA"/>; the header extensions are fully described in chapter <ptr target="#CC"/>, which should be read in conjunction with the present
chapter.
</p>
<p>The next section of the present chapter briefly introduces the
overall structure of the header, and the kinds of data it may contain.
This is followed by a detailed description of all the constituent
elements which may be used in the core header.  Section <ptr target="#HD7"/>, at the end of the present chapter, discusses the
recommended content of a minimal TEI header, and its relation to
standard library cataloguing practices.  Recommendations relevant to the
use of TEI headers as free-standing documents, for interchange among
libraries, data archives, and similar institutions may be found in
chapter <ptr target="#SH"/>.</p>

<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD1"><head>Organization of the TEI Header</head>
<div3  xml:id="HD11"><head>The TEI Header and Its Components</head>
<p>The <gi>teiHeader</gi> element should be clearly distinguished both
from the <term>prolog</term>, which comprises either the XML declaration or the SGML declaration,
and the document type declaration (see chapter <ptr target="#SG"/>); and
from the <term>front matter</term> of the text itself (for which see
section <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/>). A composite text, such as a corpus or
collection, may contain several headers, as further discussed below.  In
the usual case however, a TEI-conformant text will contain a single
<gi>teiHeader</gi> element, followed by a single <gi>text</gi> element.</p>
<p>The header element has the following description:

<specList><specDesc key="teiHeader" atts="type"/></specList>
</p>
<p>As discussed above, the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element has four principal
components:

<specList><specDesc key="fileDesc"/><specDesc key="encodingDesc"/><specDesc key="profileDesc"/><specDesc key="revisionDesc"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Of these, only the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element is required in all TEI
headers; the others are optional.  The full form of a TEI header is
thus:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>  </fileDesc>
    <encodingDesc>  </encodingDesc>
    <profileDesc>  </profileDesc>
    <revisionDesc>  </revisionDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML>

while a minimal header takes the form:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>  </fileDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML>
</p>
<p>In the case of language corpora or collections, it may be
desirable to record header information either at the level of individual
components in the corpus or collection, or once for all at the level of
the corpus or collection itself, or at both levels.  More details
concerning the tagging of composite texts are given in section <ptr target="#CC"/>, which should be read in conjunction with the current
chapter.  An optional <att>type</att> attribute may also be supplied on
the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element to indicate whether the header applies
to a corpus or a single text.  A corpus may thus take the form:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiCorpus>
   <teiHeader type="corpus">
      
   </teiHeader>
   <TEI>
      <teiHeader type="text">
         
      </teiHeader>
      <text>  </text>
   </TEI>
   <TEI>
      <teiHeader type="text">  </teiHeader>
      <text>  </text>
   </TEI>
   
</teiCorpus></egXML>
<!-- left this in for now, but I dont think it's very helpful (LB) -->
	<!-- that's cause you already know it.  the reader don't. -msm     -->
	<!-- I left it, too, but at least I fixed the outermost TEI to   -->
	<!-- teiCorpus! -sb, 2001-11-02                                  -->
</p>
<p>The tags required for the TEI header are defined in the DTD file
<ident type="file">header.dtd</ident> which first defines the
<gi>teiHeader</gi> element:

<moduleSpec xml:id="D221" ident="header">
<altIdent type="FPI">The TEI Header</altIdent><desc>The TEI
Header</desc>
</moduleSpec><!--publicID:  -//TEI P5//ELEMENTS TEI Header//EN-->
&header.odd;
&teihead.odd;
<specGrpRef target="#D221B"/>
</p>
<p>Then it defines the rest of the header elements, embedding the
DTD fragments found later in this chapter:

<specGrp xml:id="D221B">
<specGrpRef target="#D222"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D223"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D225"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D224"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D226"/></specGrp>
</p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD12"><head>Types of Content in the TEI Header</head>
<p>The elements occurring within the TEI header may contain several
types of content; the following list indicates how these types of
content are described in the following sections:

<list type="gloss"><label>free prose </label>
<item>Most elements contain simple running prose at
some level.  Many elements may contain either prose (possibly organized
into paragraphs) or more specific elements, which themselves contain
prose.  In this chapter's descriptions of element content, the phrase
<mentioned>prose description</mentioned> should be understood to imply a series of
paragraphs, each marked with the <tag>p</tag> tag.  The word
<mentioned>phrase</mentioned>, by contrast, should be understood to imply
character data, interspersed as need be with phrase-level elements, but
not organized into paragraphs.  For more information on paragraphs,
highlighted phrases, lists, etc., see section <ptr target="#COPA"/>.
</item><label>grouping elements </label>
<item>Elements whose names end with the
suffix <mentioned>Stmt</mentioned> (e.g. <gi>editionStmt</gi>,
<gi>titleStmt</gi>) usually enclose a group of specialized elements
recording some structured information.  In the case of the bibliographic
elements, the suffix <mentioned>Stmt</mentioned> is used in names of elements
corresponding to the <soCalled>areas</soCalled> of the International
Standard Bibliographic Description. <note place="foot">

For more information on this highly influential family of standards, first
proposed in 1969 by the International
Federation of Library Associations, see <ptr target="http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/isbd.htm"/>.
On the relation between the TEI proposals and other standards for
bibliographic description, see further section <ptr target="#HD8"/>.</note>
In most cases grouping elements may contain prose descriptions as an
alternative to the set of specialized elements, thus allowing the
encoder to choose whether or not the information concerned should be
presented in a structured form or in prose.
</item><label>declarations </label>
<item>Elements whose names end with the suffix
<mentioned>Decl</mentioned> (e.g.  <gi>subjectDecl</gi>, <gi>refsDecl</gi>)
enclose information about specific encoding practices applied in the
electronic text; often these practices are described in coded form.
Typically, such information takes the form of a series of declarations,
identifying a code with some more complex structure or description.  A
declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text
need not be repeated in the header of each such text.  Instead, the
<att>decls</att> attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to
which the declaration applies may be used to supply a cross
reference to it, as further described in section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.
	
</item><label>descriptions </label>
<item>Elements whose name end with the suffix
<mentioned>Desc</mentioned> (e.g.  <gi>settingDesc</gi>, <gi>projectDesc</gi>)
contain a prose description, possibly organized under some specific
headings by suggested sub-elements, but not necessarily so.
</item></list>
</p></div3></div2>
	
<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD2"><head>The File Description</head>
<p>This section describes the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element, which is the
first component of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element.
</p>
<p>The bibliographic description of a machine-readable text
resembles in structure that of a book, an article, or any other kind of
textual object.  The file description element of the TEI header has
therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library
cataloguing; it should thus provide enough information to allow users
to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and
to allow cataloguers to catalogue it.  Bibliographic citations
occurring elsewhere in the header, and also in the text itself, are
derived from the same model (on bibliographic citations in general, see
further section <ptr target="#COBI"/>).  See further section <ptr target="#HD8"/>.

</p>
<p>The bibliographic description of the electronic text (not its
source) is given in the mandatory <gi>fileDesc</gi> element:
<specList><specDesc key="fileDesc"/></specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>fileDesc</gi> element contains three mandatory elements and
four optional elements, each of which is described in more detail in
sections <ptr target="#HD21"/> to <ptr target="#HD27"/> below. These elements
are listed below in the order in which they must be given within the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element.
<specList><specDesc key="titleStmt"/><specDesc key="editionStmt"/><specDesc key="extent"/><specDesc key="publicationStmt"/><specDesc key="seriesStmt"/><specDesc key="notesStmt"/><specDesc key="sourceDesc"/></specList>
</p>
<p>A file description containing all possible subelements has the
following structure:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>
         <titleStmt>  </titleStmt>
         <editionStmt>  </editionStmt>
         <extent>  </extent>
         <publicationStmt>  </publicationStmt>
         <seriesStmt>  </seriesStmt>
         <notesStmt>  </notesStmt>
         <sourceDesc>  </sourceDesc>
    </fileDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML>

Several of these elements may be omitted; a minimal file description has
the following structure:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
    <fileDesc>
         <titleStmt>  </titleStmt>
         <publicationStmt>  </publicationStmt>
         <sourceDesc>  </sourceDesc>
    </fileDesc>
    
</teiHeader></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>fileDesc</gi> itself has the following formal definition:



<specGrp xml:id="D222" n="The file description">


&fildesc.odd;


<specGrpRef target="#D2221"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2222"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2223"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2224"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2225"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2226"/></specGrp>
</p>
<div3  xml:id="HD21"><head>The Title Statement</head>
<p>The <gi>titleStmt</gi> element is the first component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element, and is mandatory:
<specList><specDesc key="titleStmt"/></specList>
It contains the title given to the electronic work, together with
one or more optional <term>statements of responsibility</term> which
identify the encoder, author, compiler, or other parties responsible
for it:

<specList><specDesc key="title"/><specDesc key="author"/><specDesc key="sponsor"/><specDesc key="funder"/><specDesc key="principal"/><specDesc key="respStmt"/><specDesc key="resp"/><specDesc key="name"/></specList>

</p>
<p>The <gi>title</gi> element contains the chief name of the
file, including any alternative title or subtitles it may have.
It may be repeated, if the file has more than one title,
(perhaps in different languages) and takes whatever form is
considered appropriate by its creator.  Where the electronic work
is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly
recommended that the title for the former should also be derived
from the latter, but that it should be clearly distinguishable
from it.  For example, do not call the computer file <q>A
Sanskrit-English Dictionary, based upon the St. Petersburg
Lexicons</q>.  Call it, rather, <q>Sanskrit-English Dictionary,
based upon the St. Petersburg Lexicons: a machine readable
transcription</q>.  If you wish to retain some or all of the
title of the source text in the title of the computer file, then
introduce one of the following phrases:

<list type="bullets">
<item>[title of source]:  a machine readable transcription.</item>
<item>[title of source]:  electronic edition.</item>
<item>A machine readable version of:  [title of source].</item></list>

This will distinguish the computer file from the source text in
citations and in catalogues which contain descriptions of both types of
material.
</p>
<p>The computer file will almost certainly have an external name (its
<soCalled>filename</soCalled> or <soCalled>data set name</soCalled>) or reference number on the
computer system where it resides at any time.  This name is likely to
change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer
system.  Its form is entirely dependent on the particular computer
system in use and thus cannot always easily be transferred from one
system to another.  For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly
recommend that such names should <emph>not</emph> be used as the
<gi>title</gi> for any computer file.
</p>
<p>Helpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in
difficult cases may be found in the Anglo-American Cataloguing
Rules<note place="foot"><bibl>Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler, eds.,
<title>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules</title>, Second Edition
(Chicago:  American Library Association; London:  Library Association;
Ottawa:  Canadian Library Association, 1978).</bibl></note>
(AACR 2), chapter 25, or in equivalent national-level bibliographical
documentation.

</p>
<p>The specialized elements <gi>author</gi>, <gi>sponsor</gi>,
<gi>funder</gi>, and <gi>principal</gi>, and the more general
<gi>respStmt</gi> provide the <term>statements of responsibility</term>
which identify the persons responsible for the intellectual or artistic
content of an item and any corporate bodies from which it emanates.
</p>
<p>Any number of statements of responsibility may occur within the title
statement.  At a minimum, identify the author of the text and the
creator of the machine-readable file.  If the bibliographic description
is for a corpus, identify the creator of the corpus.  These
identifications are mandatory when applicable, though not enforceable by
the parser.  Optionally include also names of others involved in
the transcription or elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding
agencies.  The name of the person responsible for physical data input
need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also intellectually
responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file.
</p>
<p>Where the person whose responsibility is to be documented is not an
author, sponsor, funding body, or principal researcher, the <gi>respStmt</gi>
element should be used.  This has two subcomponents: a <gi>name</gi>
element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a
<gi>resp</gi> element indicating the nature of the responsibility.  No
specific recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content
for the <gi>resp</gi>:  it should make clear the nature of the
responsibility concerned, as in the examples below.
</p>
<p>Names given may be personal names or corporate names.  Give all names
in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited.
This would usually be the fullest form of the name, including first
names.<note place="foot">Agencies compiling catalogues of
machine-readable files are recommended to use available authority lists,
such as the Library of Congress Name Authority List, for all common
personal names.</note>

</p>
<p>The formal definition of the <gi>titleStmt</gi> element and its
constituents is as follows:



<specGrp xml:id="D2221" n="The title statement">



&titstmt.odd;

&sponsor.odd;
&funder.odd;
&principl.odd;

<p>The TITLE, AUTHOR, NAME, RESPSTMT, and RESP elements are
declared in file teicore2.dtd, not here.</p></specGrp>

</p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD22"><head>The Edition Statement</head>
<p>The <gi>editionStmt</gi> element is the second component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element.  It is optional but recommended.
<specList><specDesc key="editionStmt"/></specList>

It contains either phrases or more specialized elements identifying the
edition and those responsible for it:

<specList><specDesc key="edition"/><specDesc key="respStmt"/><specDesc key="name"/><specDesc key="resp"/></specList>
</p>
<p>For printed texts, the word <mentioned>edition</mentioned> applies to the set
of all the identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and
issued by a particular publishing agency or a group of such agencies.  A
change in the identity of the distributing body or bodies does not
normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the master
copy does.
</p>
<p>For electronic texts, the notion of a <soCalled>master copy</soCalled> is not
entirely appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified
than printed ones; nonetheless the term <mentioned>edition</mentioned> may be used
for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which substantive
changes are made and fixed.  Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines
are <mentioned>version,</mentioned> <mentioned>level,</mentioned> and <mentioned>release</mentioned>.  The words
<mentioned>revision</mentioned> and <mentioned>update</mentioned>, by contrast, are used for minor
changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition.
</p>
<p>No simple rule can specify how <soCalled>substantive</soCalled>
changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a new edition,
rather than a simple update.  The general principle proposed here is
that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the
intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or
appearance.  The addition of analytic coding to a text would thus
constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded
representation to another would not.  Changes relating to the character
code or physical storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple
changes in the arrangement of the contents and changes in the output
format do not normally constitute a new edition.  The addition of new
information (e.g. a linguistic analysis expressed in part-of-speech
tagging, sound or graphics, referential links to external datasets)
almost always does constitute a new edition.
</p>
<p>Clearly, there are always border line cases and the matter is
somewhat arbitrary.  The simplest rule is:  if you think that your file
is a new edition, then call it such.
An edition statement is optional for the first release of a
machine-readable file; it is mandatory for each later release,
though this requirement cannot be enforced by the parser.
</p>
<p>Note that <emph>all</emph> changes in a file, whether or not they are
regarded as constituting a new edition or simply a new revision, should
be independently noted in the revision description section of the file
header (see section <ptr target="#HD6"/>).
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
</p>
<p>The <gi>edition</gi> element should contain phrases describing the
edition or version, including the word <mentioned>edition</mentioned>,
<mentioned>version</mentioned>, or equivalent, together with a number or date,
or terms indicating difference from other editions such as <mentioned>new
edition</mentioned>, <mentioned>revised edition</mentioned> etc.  Any dates that
occur within the edition statement should be marked with the
<gi>date</gi> element.  The <att>n</att> attribute of the
<gi>edition</gi> element may be used as elsewhere to supply any formal
identification (such as a version number) for the edition.
</p>
<p>One or more <gi>respStmt</gi> elements may also be used to supply
statements of responsibility for the edition in question.  These may
refer to individuals or corporate bodies and can indicate functions such
as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body responsible for the
provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new
edition.  For further detail on the <gi>respStmt</gi> element,
see section <ptr target="#COBI"/>.</p>
<p>Some examples follow:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><editionStmt>
  <edition n="P2">Second draft, substantially
       extended, revised, and corrected.</edition>
</editionStmt></egXML>

<respStmt>
  <resp>New annotations by</resp>

</respStmt>
</editionStmt></egXML>

The formal definition of the <gi>editionStmt</gi> element is as follows:

<!-- removed file attrib since it was confusing dtdGen LB, 20 may 01 -->

<specGrp xml:id="D2222" n="The edition statement">


&edstmt.odd;













&edition.odd;










</specGrp>
</p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD23"><head>Type and Extent of File</head>
<p>The <gi>extent</gi> element is the third component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element.  It is optional.
<specList><specDesc key="extent"/></specList>
</p>
<p>For printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of
medium used and its size, are of great importance in cataloguing
procedures.  The print-oriented rules for bibliographic description of
an item's medium and extent need some re-interpretation when applied to
electronic media.  An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite
independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object
whether it is stored on a magnetic tape, a CD-ROM, a set of floppy disks,
or as a file on a mainframe computer.  Since, moreover, these Guidelines
are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document storage and
interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be
irrelevant as far as the file header is concerned.
</p>
<p>This is particularly true of information about <term>file-type</term>
although library-oriented rules for cataloguing often distinguish two
types of computer file:  <q>data</q> and <q>programs</q>.  This
distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example,
hypermedia or texts with built in search and retrieval software.

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
</p>
<p>Although it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of
the computer file may be of use for cataloguing and other practical
purposes.  Because the measurement and expression of file size is
fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are
possible; the element <gi>extent</gi> is provided for this purpose.  It
contains a phrase indicating the size or approximate size of the
computer file in one of the following ways:

<list type="bullets">
<item>in bytes of a specified length (e.g. <q>4000 16-bit bytes</q>)</item>
<item>as falling within a range of categories, for example:
<list type="bullets">
<item>less than 1 Mb</item>
<item>between 1 Mb and 5 Mb</item>
<item>between 6 Mb and 10 Mb</item>
<item>over 10 Mb</item></list></item>
<item>in terms of any convenient logical units (for example,
words or sentences, citations, paragraphs)</item>
<item>in terms of any convenient physical units (for example,
blocks, disks, tapes)</item></list>

<p>The <gi>publicationStmt</gi> element is the fourth component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element and is mandatory.

<specList><specDesc key="publicationStmt"/></specList>

It may contain either a simple prose description, or groups of the
elements described below:

<specList><specDesc key="publisher"/><specDesc key="distributor"/><specDesc key="authority"/></specList>
</p>
<p>The <term>publisher</term> is the person or institution by whose
authority a given edition of the file is made public.  The
<term>distributor</term> is the person or institution from whom copies
of the text may be obtained.  Where a text is not considered formally
published, but is nevertheless made available for circulation by some
individual or organization, this person or institution is termed the
<term>release authority</term>.
</p>
<p>At least one of the above three elements must be present, unless the
entire publication statement is given as prose.  Each may be followed by
one or more of the following elements, in the following order:

<specList><specDesc key="pubPlace"/><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="idno" atts="type"/><specDesc key="availability" atts="status"/><specDesc key="date"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Note that the dates, places, etc., given in the publication statement
relate to the publisher, distributor, or release authority most recently
mentioned.  If the text was created at some date other than its date of
publication, its date of creation should be given within the
<gi>profileDesc</gi> element, not in the publication statement.  Give
any other useful dates (e.g., dates of collection of data) in a note.
</p>
<p>Additional detailed tagsets may be used for the encoding of names,
dates, and addresses, as further described in section <ptr target="#CONA"/>
and chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>.

<div3  xml:id="HD26"><head>The Series Statement</head>
<p>The <gi>seriesStmt</gi> element is the fifth component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element and is optional.

<specList><specDesc key="seriesStmt"/></specList>
</p>
<p>In bibliographic parlance, a <term>series</term> may be defined in
one of the following ways:

<list type="bullets">
<item>A group of separate items related to one another by the fact
that each item bears, in addition to its own title proper, a
collective title applying to the group as a whole.  The
individual items may or may not be numbered.</item>
<item>Each of two or more volumes of essays, lectures, articles,
or other items, similar in character and issued in sequence.</item>
<item>A separately numbered sequence of volumes within a series or
serial.</item></list>

The <gi>seriesStmt</gi> element may contain a prose description or one
or more of the following more specific elements:

<specList><specDesc key="title"/><specDesc key="idno"/><specDesc key="respStmt"/><specDesc key="resp"/><specDesc key="name"/></specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>idno</gi> may be used to supply any identifying number
associated with the item, including both standard numbers such as an
ISSN and particular issue numbers. (Arabic numerals separated by
punctuation are recommended for this purpose: <code>6.19.33</code>,
for example, rather than <code>VI/xix:33</code>). Its <att>type</att> attribute is used to categorize
the number further, taking the value <code type="value">ISSN</code> for an ISSN for
example.
</p>
<p>Examples:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seriesStmt>

</specGrp>

Its components are all defined elsewhere.
</p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD27"><head>The Notes Statement</head>
<p>The <gi>notesStmt</gi> element is the sixth component of the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element and is optional.  If used, it contains one or
more <gi>note</gi> elements, each containing a single piece of
descriptive information of the kind treated as <soCalled>general
notes</soCalled> in traditional bibliographic descriptions.

<specList><specDesc key="notesStmt"/><specDesc key="note"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Some information found in the notes area in conventional bibliography
has been assigned specific elements in these Guidelines; in particular
the following items should be tagged as indicated, rather than as
general notes:

<list type="bullets">
<item>the nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the file; also
the genre or other intellectual category to which it may belong:
e.g. <q>Text types:  newspaper editorials and reportage, science
fiction, westerns, and detective stories</q>. These should be
formally described within the <gi>profileDesc</gi> element
(section <ptr target="#HD4"/>).</item>
<item>summary description providing a factual, non-evaluative
account of the subject content of the file.  E.g. <q>Transcribes
interviews on general topics with native speakers of English in
17 cities during the spring and summer of 1963.</q> These should
also be formally described within the <gi>profileDesc</gi> element
(section <ptr target="#HD4"/>).</item>
<item>bibliographic details relating to the source or sources of
an electronic text: e.g. <q>Transcribed from the Norton
facsimile of the 1623 Folio</q>. These should be formally
described in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element
(section <ptr target="#HD3"/>).</item>
<item>further information relating to publication, distribution,
or release of the text, including sources from which the text
may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or formal terms on
its availability.  These should be placed in the appropriate
division of the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> element
(section <ptr target="#HD24"/>).</item>
<item>publicly documented numbers associated with the file:  e.g.
<q>ICPSR study number 1803</q> or <q>Oxford Text Archive text
number 1243</q>.  These should be placed in an <gi>idno</gi>
element within the appropriate division of the
<gi>publicationStmt</gi> element.  International Standard
Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers
(ISBN), and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers
that uniquely identify an item, should be treated in the same
way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes.</item></list>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <gi>notesStmt</gi> element may be used to record
potentially significant details about the file and its features, e.g.:

<list type="bullets">
<item>dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the
computer file:  e.g.  <q>manual dated 1983,</q> <q>Interview wave I:
Apr. 1989; wave II: Jan. 1990</q></item>
<item>names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production,
administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced
the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in
the title or edition statements of the file description:
e.g. <q>Historical commentary provided by Mark Cohen</q></item>
<item>availability of the file in an additional medium or information not
already recorded about the availability of documentation:
e.g. <q>User manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sections</q></item>
<item>language of work and abstract:  e.g. <q>Text in English with
summaries in French and German</q></item>
<item>The unique name assigned to a serial by the International Serials
Data System (ISDS)</item>
<item>lists of related publications, either describing the source itself,
or concerned with the creation or use of the machine-readable file, e.g.
<q>Texts used in <bibl><title>Computation into Criticism</title>
(Oxford, 1987)</bibl></q></item></list>
</p>
<p>Each such item of information should be tagged using the
general-purpose <gi>note</gi> element, which is described in section <ptr target="#CONO"/>.  Groups of notes are contained within the
<gi>notesStmt</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><notesStmt>
  <note>Historical commentary provided by Mark Cohen.</note>
  <note>OCR scanning done at University of Toronto.</note>

<div3 xml:id="HD3"><head>The Source Description</head>
	
<p>The <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element is the seventh and final component of
the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element.  It is a mandatory element, and is used to
record details of the source or sources from which a computer file is
derived.  This might be a printed text or manuscript, another computer
file, an audio or video recording of some kind, or a combination of
these.  An electronic file may also have no source, if what is being
catalogued is an original text created in electronic form.
<specList><specDesc key="sourceDesc"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element may contain a simple prose
description, or, more usefully, a bibliographic citation of some kind
specifying the provenance of the text.  For written or printed sources,
the source should be described in the same way as any other
bibliographic citation, using one of the following elements:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="bibl"/>
<specDesc key="biblItem"/>
<specDesc key="biblFull"/>
<specDesc key="biblStruct"/>
<specDesc key="listBibl"/>
</specList>
 
These elements are described in more detail in section <ptr target="#COBI"/>
.</p>
<p>When the header describes a transcription of spoken material, the
<gi>sourceDesc</gi> element may also include the following
special-purpose elements, intended for cases where an electronic text
is derived from a spoken text rather than a written one:
<specList><specDesc key="scriptStmt"/><specDesc key="recordingStmt"/></specList>
Full descriptions of these elements and their contents are given in
section <ptr target="#HD32"/>.</p>
<p>The <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element may contain a mixture of one or more
of the above elements, as in the following examples:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sourceDesc>
   <bibl>The first folio of Shakespeare, prepared by
   Charlton Hinman (The Norton Facsimile, 1968)</bibl>

 </p>
<p>The source description itself has the following formal definition:

&soustmt.odd;
<specGrpRef target="#D2231"/>
</specGrp>
 </p></div3>
<div3 xml:id="HD31"><head>Computer Files Derived from Other Computer Files
 </head>
<p>If a machine-readable text (call it B) is based not on a
printed source but upon another machine-readable text (call it
A) which includes a TEI file header, then the source text of
computer file B is another computer file, A.  The four sections
of A's file header will need to be incorporated into the new
header for B in slightly differing ways, as listed below:
 
<list type="gloss"><label>fileDesc</label>
<item>A's file description should be copied into the
<gi>sourceDesc</gi> section of B's file description, enclosed
within a <gi>biblFull</gi> element
(see section <ptr target="#COBI"/>).
	
 </item><label>profileDesc</label>
<item>A's <gi>profileDesc</gi> should be
copied into B's, in principle unchanged.
 </item><label>encodingDesc</label>
<item>A's coding practice may or (more likely) may not be the
same as B's. Since the object of the coding description is to
define the relationship between the current file and its source,
in principle only changes in encoding practice between A and B
need be documented in B. The relationship between A and its
source(s) is then only recoverable from the original header of
A. In practice it may be more convenient to create a new
complete <gi>encodingDesc</gi> for B based on A's.
 </item><label>revisionDesc</label>
<item>B is a new electronic file, and should therefore have a
new revision description. If, however, it is felt useful to
include some information from A's <gi>revisionDesc</gi>, for
example dates of major updates or versions, such information
must be clearly marked as relating to A rather than to B.
 </item></list>
 </p></div3>
<div3 xml:id="HD32"><head>Computer Files Composed of Transcribed Speech
 </head>
<p>Where an electronic text is derived from a spoken text rather than a
written one, it will usually be desirable to record additional
information about the recording or broadcast which constitutes its
source.  Several additional elements are provided for this purpose
within the source description element:
 
<specList><specDesc key="scriptStmt"/><specDesc key="recordingStmt"/><specDesc key="recording" atts="type dur"/><specDesc key="equipment"/><specDesc key="broadcast"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Note that detailed information about the participants or setting of
an interview or other transcript of spoken language should be recorded
in the appropriate division of the profile description, discussed in
chapter <ptr target="#CC"/>, rather than as part of the source
description.  The source description is used to hold information only
about the source from which the transcribed speech was taken, for
example, any script being read and any technical details of how the
recording was  produced.  If the source was a previously-created
transcript, it should be treated in the same way as any other source
text.
 </p>
<p>The <gi>scriptStmt</gi> element should be used where it is known that
one or more of the participants in a spoken text is speaking from a
previously prepared script.  The script itself should be documented in
the same way as any other written text, using one of the three citation
tags mentioned above.  Utterances or groups of utterances may be linked
to the script concerned by means of the <att>decls</att> attribute,
described in section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.<!-- was:  target='P2.3431'>. -->
	<!-- or :  target='SP31'>. -->
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sourceDesc>
  <scriptStmt xml:id="CNN12">

    </bibl>
  </scriptStmt>
  
  
</sourceDesc></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>recordingStmt</gi> is used to group together information
relating to the recordings from which the spoken text was transcribed.
The element may contain either a prose description or, more helpfully,
one or more <gi>recording</gi> elements, each corresponding with a
particular recording.  The linkage between utterances or groups of
utterances and the relevant recording statement is made by means of the
<att>decls</att> attribute, described in section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.

	
 </p>
<p>The <gi>recording</gi> element should be used to provide a
description of how and by whom a recording was made.  This information
may be a prose description, within which such items as statements of
responsibility, names, places and dates should be identified using the
appropriate phrase level tags.  The <gi>recording</gi> element takes two
additional attributes, as indicated above:  <att>type</att> is used to
specify the kind of recording concerned and <att>dur</att> to specify
its length.
 </p>
<p>In addition, descriptive information relating to the kind of
recording equipment used should be specified using the
<gi>equipment</gi> element.  Where a recording is taken from a public
broadcast, details of the broadcast should be given using the
<gi>broadcast</gi> element described further below.  Specialized
collections may wish to add further sub-elements to these major
components.  Note however that this element should be used only for
information relating to the recording process itself; information about
the setting or participants (for example) is recorded elsewhere:  see
sections <ptr target="#CCAHSE"/> and <ptr target="#CCAHPA"/> below.
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><recording type="video">

<p>When a recording has been made from a public broadcast, details of
the broadcast itself should be supplied within the <gi>recording</gi>
element, as a nested <gi>broadcast</gi> element.  A broadcast is closely
analogous to a publication and the <gi>broadcast</gi> element should
therefore contain one or the other of the bibliographic citation
elements <gi>bibl</gi>, <gi>biblStruct</gi>, or <gi>biblFull</gi>.  The
broadcasting agency responsible for a broadcast is regarded as its
author, while other participants (for example interviewers,
interviewees, directors, producers, etc.) should be specified using the
<gi>respStmt</gi> or <gi>editor</gi> element with an appropriate
<gi>resp</gi> (see further section <ptr target="#COBI"/>).<!-- was:  target='P2.235'>). -->

<p>When a broadcast contains several distinct recordings (for example a

<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD5"><head>The Encoding Description</head>
<p>The <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element is the second major subdivision of
the TEI header.  It specifies the methods and editorial principles which
governed the transcription or encoding of the text in hand and may also
include sets of coded definitions used by other components of the
header.  Though not formally required, its use is highly recommended.
<specList>
<specDesc key="encodingDesc"/>
</specList>
The content of the encoding description may be a prose description, or
it may contain elements from the following list, in the order given:
<specList>
<specDesc key="projectDesc"/>
<specDesc key="samplingDecl"/>
<specDesc key="editorialDecl"/>
<specDesc key="tagsDecl"/>
<specDesc key="refsDecl"/>
<specDesc key="classDecl"/>
<specDesc key="fsdDecl"/>

<div3  xml:id="HD51"><head>The Project Description</head>
<p>The <gi>projectDesc</gi> element is the first of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It may be used to
describe, in prose, the purpose for which the electronic file was
encoded, together with any other relevant information concerning the
process by which it was assembled or collected.  This is of particular
importance for corpora or miscellaneous collections, but may be of use
for any text, for example to explain why one kind of encoding practice
has been followed rather than another.

<div3  xml:id="HD52"><head>The Sampling Declaration</head>
<p>The <gi>samplingDecl</gi> element is the second of the nine optional

description of the rationale and methods used in sampling texts, for
example to create a representative corpus.
<specList>
<specDesc key="samplingDecl"/>
</specList>
It should include information about such matters as

<p>A sampling declaration which applies to more than one text or
division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text.
Instead, the <att>decls</att> attribute of each text (or subdivision of
the text) to which the sampling declaration applies may be used to
supply a cross reference to it, as further described in section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.	
This element has the following formal declaration:
 
<specGrp xml:id="D2252" n="The sampling declaration">&sampdecl.odd;</specGrp></p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD53"><head>The Editorial Practices Declaration</head>
<p>The <gi>editorialDecl</gi> element is the third of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to
provide details of the editorial practices applied during the encoding
of a text.
<specList>
<specDesc key="editorialDecl"/>
</specList>
It may contain a prose description only, or one or more of the following
specialized elements:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="correction" atts="status method"/>
<specDesc key="normalization" atts="source method"/>
<specDesc key="quotation" atts="marks form"/>
<specDesc key="hyphenation" atts="eol"/>
<specDesc key="segmentation"/>
<specDesc key="stdVals"/>
<specDesc key="interpretation"/>
</specList>
 
These elements are all members of the TEI <ident>policy</ident>
class. Where an encoder wishes to record an editorial policy not
specified above, they may do so by adding a new element to this
class, using the mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr
target="#MD"/>.</p><p>Some of these policy elements carry attributes to support automated processing
of certain well-defined editorial decisions; all of them contain a prose
description of the editorial principles adopted with respect to the
particular feature concerned.  Examples of the kinds of questions which
these descriptions are intended to answer are listed below, in the same
order as the list above. 
 
<list type="gloss"><label><gi>correction</gi></label>
<item>Was the text corrected during or after data capture?  If
so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the
tags described in section <ptr target="#COED"/>?  What principles
	
have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious
corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.?</item><label><gi>normalization</gi></label>
<item>Was the text normalized, for example by regularizing any
non-standard spellings, dialect forms, etc.?  If so, were normalizations
performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in
section <ptr target="#COED"/>?
	
What authority was used for the regularization?  Also, what principles
were used when normalizing dates or numbers to provide the standard
values for the <att>value</att> attribute described in sections <ptr target="#CONANU"/> and <ptr target="#CONADA"/>	
and what format used for them?</item><label><gi>quotation</gi></label>
<item>How were quotation marks processed?  Are apostrophes and quotation
marks distinguished?  How?  Are quotation marks retained as content in
the text or replaced by markup?  Was the <att>rendition</att> attribute
used to record the specific appearance of any quotation marks removed
from the text?  Are there any special conventions regarding for example
the use of single or double quotation marks when nested?  Is the file
consistent in its practice or has this not been checked?</item><label><gi>hyphenation</gi></label>
<item>Does the encoding distinguish <soCalled>soft</soCalled> and
<soCalled>hard</soCalled> hyphens?
What principle has been adopted with respect to end-of-line hyphenation
where source lineation has not been retained?  Have soft hyphens been
silently removed, and if so what is the effect on lineation and
pagination?</item><label><gi>segmentation</gi></label>
<item>How is the text segmented?  If
<gi>s</gi> or <gi>seg</gi> segmentation units have been used to divide
up the text for analysis, how are they marked and how was the
segmentation arrived at?</item><label><gi>stdVals</gi></label>
<item>What standardization methods underlie any standardized values
supplied for numeric values or dates?  If the <att>value</att> attribute
described in section <ptr target="#CONADA"/> has been used,
	
in what format are its values presented?</item><label><gi>interpretation</gi></label>
<item>Has any analytic or <soCalled>interpretive</soCalled> information
been provided &#x2014; that is, information which is felt to be non-obvious,
contentious, or subject to disagreement? If so, how was it generated?
How was it encoded? If feature-structure analysis has been used, are
<gi>fsdDecl</gi> elements (section <ptr target="#HDFSD"/>) present?</item></list></p>
<p>Any information about the editorial principles applied not falling
under one of the above headings should be recorded in a distinct list
of items.  Experience shows that a full record should be kept of
decisions relating to editorial principles and encoding practice,
both for future users of the text and for the project which produced
the text in the first instance. A simple example follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><editorialDecl>
  <interpretation>
    <p>The part of speech analysis applied throughout section 4 was
      added by hand and has not been checked.</p>
  </interpretation>
  <correction>
    <p>Errors in transcription controlled by using the
      WordPerfect spelling checker.</p>
  </correction>
  <normalization uri="http://www.dict.sztaki.hu/webster">
    <p>All words converted to Modern American spelling using
      Websters 9th Collegiate dictionary.</p>
  </normalization>
  <quotation marks="all" form="std">
    <p>All opening quotation marks represented by entity reference ODQ; all closing
      quotation marks represented by entity reference CDQ.</p>
  </quotation>
</editorialDecl></egXML>
</p>
<p>These elements are formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="D2253" n="The editorial practices declaration">
&policy.odd;
&eddecl.odd;
&correctn.odd;
&normalzn.odd;
&quotn.odd;
&hyphen.odd;
&segmentn.odd;
&stdvals.odd;
&interptn.odd;
</specGrp>
 
An editorial practices declaration which applies to more than one text
or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such
text.  Instead, the <att>decls</att> attribute of each text (or
subdivision of the text) to which it applies may
be used to supply a cross reference to it, as further described in
section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.
	</p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD57"><head>The Tagging Declaration</head>
<p>The <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element is the fourth of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to record
the following information about the tagging used within a particular
text:
<list type="simple">
<item>how often particular elements appear within the text, so that
a recipient can validate the integrity of a text during interchange.</item>
<item>any comment relating to the usage of particular elements not
specified elsewhere in the header.</item>
<item>a definition for the default rendition applying to all instances
of an element, unless otherwise stated by the global <att>rend</att>
attribute.</item></list></p>
<p>This information is conveyed by the following elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="rendition"/>
<specDesc key="tagUsage" atts="occurs withId render"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element consists of an optional sequence of
<gi>rendition</gi> elements, each of which must bear a unique
identifier, followed by a sequence of <gi>tagUsage</gi> elements, one
for each distinct element occurring within the outermost
<gi>text</gi> element of a TEI document.</p>
<p>The <gi>rendition</gi> element defined in this version of the TEI
Guidelines is a preliminary proposal only, intended to provide a hook
for more detailed specifications of default rendition in later versions.
 	</p>
<p>The present proposal allows the encoder to enter an informal
description of a rendition, or style, as running prose only. This
rendition will be assumed to apply, by default, to all occurrences of
an element which names its identifier as the value of the
<att>render</att> attribute of the appropriate <gi>tagUsage</gi>
element. For element occurrences to which this default rendition does
not apply, the encoder should specify an explicit description using the
global <att>rend</att> attribute on the elements concerned.</p>
<p>For example, the following schematic shows how an encoder might
specify that <gi>p</gi> elements are by default to be rendered using one
set of specifications identified as <code type="value">style1</code>,
while <gi>hi</gi>
elements are to use a different set, identified as <code type="value">style2</code>:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><tagsDecl>
   <rendition xml:id="style1">   
      ... description of one default rendition here ...
   </rendition>
   <rendition xml:id="style2">   
      ... description of another default rendition here ...
   </rendition>
   <tagUsage gi="p" render="#style1"> ... </tagUsage>
   <tagUsage gi="hi" render="#style2"> ... </tagUsage>
   
</tagsDecl></egXML></p><p>No detailed proposals for the content of the <gi>rendition</gi>
element have as yet been formulated. Earlier versions of
these Guidelines suggested that specifications derived from,
or compatible with, the properties standardized as part of
the Document Style and Semantics Specification Language
(ISO/IEC 10179) might be useful; the Cascading Stylesheet
Language (<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1"/>) is another possible candidate
vehicle for their expression, as is the XML vocabulary for
specifying formatting semantics which forms a part of the
W3C's Extensible Stylesheet Language (<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl"/>).</p> <p>A <gi>tagsDecl</gi> need not specify
any <gi>rendition</gi> element.  It must however 
contain exactly one occurrence of a <gi>tagUsage</gi>
element for each distinct element marked within the
outermost <gi>text</gi> element associated with the
<gi>teiHeader</gi> in which it appears.<note place="foot">In the case of a TEI corpus (<ptr target="#CC"/>), a
<gi>tagsDecl</gi> in a corpus header will describe tag usage across
the whole corpus, while one in an individual text header will describe
tag usage for the individual text concerned.</note> The <gi>tagUsage</gi> element is
used to supply a count of the number of occurrences of this
	  element within the text, which is given as the value of its
	  <att>occurs</att> attribute.  It may also be used to hold
	  any additional usage information, which is supplied as
	  running prose within the element itself.</p> <p>For example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><tagUsage gi="hi" occurs="28">
    Used only to mark English words italicised in the copy text.
</tagUsage></egXML>
 
This indicates that the <gi>hi</gi> element appears a total of 28 times
in the <gi>text</gi> element in question, and that the encoder has used
it to mark italicised English phrases only.</p>
<p>The <att>ident</att> attribute may optionally be used to specify how
many of the occurrences of the element in question bear a value for the
global <att>xml:id</att> attribute, as in the following example:
 
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><tagUsage gi="pb" occurs="321" withId="321">
    Marks page breaks in the York (1734) edition only
</tagUsage></egXML>
 
This indicates that the <gi>pb</gi> element occurs 321 times, on each
of which an identifier is provided.</p>
<p>The content of the <gi>tagUsage</gi> element is not susceptible of
automatic processing.  It should not therefore be used to hold
information for which provision is already made by other components of
the encoding description.  A TEI conformant document is not required
to contain a <gi>tagsDecl</gi> element, but if one is present, it must
contain <gi>tagUsage</gi> elements for each distinct element marked in
the associated text, and the counts specified by their <att>occurs</att>
attributes must correspond with the number of such elements present in the
document, as identified by some conforming processor.

<div3  xml:id="HD54"><head>The Reference System Declaration</head>
<p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is the fifth of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element. It is used to
document the way in which any standard referencing scheme built into
the encoding works, either as a series of prose paragraphs or by
using the following specialized elements:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="refsDecl" atts="doctype"/>
<?tei winita insert <specDesc key="fragmentPattern"/> or whatever it's called here ?>
<specDesc key="state"/>
</specList>
 
Note that not all possible referencing schemes are equally easily
supported by current software systems.  A choice must be made between
the convenience of the encoder and the likely efficiency of the
particular software applications envisaged, in this context as in many
others. For a more detailed discussion of referencing
systems supported by these Guidelines, see section <ptr target="#CORS"/> below.
	</p>
<p>A referencing scheme may be described in one of three ways using this
element:
 
<list type="bullets">
<item>as a prose description</item>
<item>as a series of pairs of regular expressions and XPaths</item>
<item>as a concatenation of sequentially organized
<term>milestone</term>s</item></list>
 
Each method is described in more detail below. Only one method can be
used within a single <gi>refsDecl</gi> element.</p>
<p>More than one <gi>refsDecl</gi> element can be included in the
header if more than one canonical reference scheme is to be used in
the same document, but the current proposals do not check for mutual
inconsistency. A reference declaration can only describe the
referencing system applicable to a single document type; if therefore
concurrent document types are in use (as discussed in section <ptr target="#CORS"/>), a <gi>refsDecl</gi> element must be supplied for
each; the <att>doctype</att> attribute should be used to specify the
document type to which the declaration relates.</p>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="HD54P"><head>Prose Method</head>
<p>The referencing scheme may be specified within the <gi>refsDecl</gi>
by a simple prose description.  Such a description should indicate which
elements carry identifying information, and whether this information is
represented as attribute values or as content.  Any special rules about
how the information is to be interpreted when reading or generating a
reference string should also be specified here.  Such a prose
description cannot be processed automatically, and this method of
specifying the structure of a canonical reference system is therefore
not recommended for automatic processing.</p>
<p>For example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <p>The <att>n</att> attribute of each text in this corpus carries a
  unique identifying code for the whole text. The title of the text is
  held as the content of the first <gi>head</gi> element within each
  text. The <att>n</att> attribute on each <gi>div1</gi> and
  <gi>div2</gi> contains the canonical reference for each such
  division, in the form 'XX.yyy', where XX is the book number in Roman
  numerals, and yyy the section number in arabic. Line breaks are
  marked by empty <gi>lb</gi> elements, each of which includes the
  through line number in Casaubon's edition as the value of its
  <gi>n</gi> attribute.</p>
  <p>The through line number and the text identifier uniquely identify
  any line. A canonical reference may be made up by concatenating the
  <gi>n</gi> values from the <gi>text</gi>, <gi>div1</gi>, or
  <gi>div2</gi> and calculating the line number within each part.</p>
</refsDecl></egXML></p></div4><div4 type="Section" xml:id="HD54S">
<head>Search-and-Replace Method</head>
<p>This method often requires a significant investment of effort
initially, but permits extremely flexible addressing. For details, see
section <ptr target="#SACR"/>.
<?tei winita This section must be completely rewritten based on what is now #SACR. ?>
<specList>
  <specDesc key="fragmentPattern"/>
</specList>
</p></div4><div4 type="Section" xml:id="HD54M"><head>Milestone Method</head>
<p>This method is appropriate when only <soCalled>milestone</soCalled>
tags (see section <ptr target="#CORS5"/>) are available to provide the
required referencing information. It does not provide any abilities
which cannot be mimicked by the search-and-replace referencing method
discussed in the previous section, but in the cases where it applies,
it provides a somewhat simpler notation.</p>
<p>A reference based on milestone tags concatenates the values specified
by one or more such tags.  Since each tag marks the point at which a
value changes, it may be regarded as specifying the <term>state</term>
of a variable.  A reference declaration using this method therefore
specifies the individual components of the canonical reference as a
sequence of <gi>state</gi> elements:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="state" atts="ed unit delim length"/>
</specList></p>
<p>For example, the reference <q>Matthew 12:34</q> might be thought of
as representing the state of three variables:  the <q>book</q> variable
is in state <q>Matthew</q>; the <ident type="var">chapter</ident> variable
is in state <q>12</q>, and the <ident type="var">verse</ident> variable is
in state <q>34</q>.  If milestone tagging has been used, there should be
a tag marking the point in the text at which each of the above
<soCalled>variables</soCalled> changes its state.<note place="foot">On the
milestone tag itself, what are here referred to as
<soCalled>variables</soCalled> are identified by the combination of the
<att>ed</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes.</note>
To find <q>Matthew 12:34</q> therefore an application must scan left to
right through the text, monitoring changes in the state of each of these
three variables as it does so.  When all three are simultaneously in the
required state, the desired point will have been reached.  There may of
course be several such points.</p>
<p>The <att>delim</att> and <att>length</att> attributes are used to
specify components of a canonical reference using this method in exactly
the same way as for the stepwise method described in the preceding
section.  The other attributes are used to determine which instances of
<gi>milestone</gi> tags in the text are to be checked for state-changes.
A state-change is signalled whenever a new <gi>milestone</gi> tag is
found with <att>unit</att> and, optionally, <att>ed</att> attributes
identical to those of the <gi>state</gi> element in question.  The value
for the new state may be given explicitly by the <att>n</att> attribute
on the <gi>milestone</gi> element, or it may be implied, if the
<att>n</att> attribute is not specified.</p>
<p>For example, for canonical references in the form <mentioned>xx.yyy</mentioned> where
the <mentioned>xx</mentioned> represents the page number in the first edition, and
<mentioned>yyy</mentioned> the line number within this page, a reference system
declaration such as the following would be appropriate:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
   <state ed="first" unit="page" length="2" delim="."/>
   <state ed="first" unit="line" length="3"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
 
This implies that milestone tags of the form
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone n="II" ed="first" unit="page"/>
<milestone ed="first" unit="line"/></egXML>
 
will be found throughout the text, marking the positions at which page
and line numbers change. Note that no value has been specified for the
<att>n</att> attribute on the second milestone tag above; this implies
that its value at each state change is monotonically increased.
For more detail on the use of milestone tags,
see section <ptr target="#CORS5"/>.<!-- was:  target='P2.232ms'> -->
	<!-- was:  target='CORSYS5' > -->
	<!-- following algorithm should also be moved to CREF --></p>
<p>The milestone referencing scheme, though conceptually simple, is not 
supported by a generic SGML or XML parser.  Its use places a
correspondingly greater burden of verification and accuracy on the
encoder.</p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section are formally defined as
follows:
 <specGrp xml:id="D2254" n="The reference scheme declaration">
  &refsdecl.odd;
  &fragmentpattern.odd;
  &state.odd;
</specGrp></p><p>A reference system declaration which applies to more than one text or
division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text.
Instead, the <att>decls</att> attribute of each text (or subdivision of
the text) to which the declaration applies may be used to supply a cross
reference to it, as further described in section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>.</p>
</div4></div3>
	
<div3  xml:id="HD55"><head>The Classification Declaration</head>
<p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element is the sixth of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to group
together definitions or sources for any descriptive classification
schemes used by other parts of the header.  Each such scheme is
represented by a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element, which may contain either a
simple bibliographic citation, or a definition of the
descriptive typology concerned; the following elements are used
in defining a descriptive classification scheme:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="classDecl"/>
<specDesc key="taxonomy"/>
<specDesc key="category"/>
<specDesc key="catDesc"/>
</specList>
 
The <gi>taxonomy</gi> element has two slightly different, but related,
functions. For well-recognized and documented public classification
schemes, such as Dewey or other published descriptive thesauri, it
contains simply a bibliographic citation indicating where a full
description of a particular taxonomy may be found.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><taxonomy xml:id="ddc12">
  <bibl>
    <title>Dewey Decimal Classification</title>
    <edition>Abridged Edition 12</edition>
    
  </bibl>
</taxonomy></egXML>
 
For less easily accessible schemes, the <gi>taxonomy</gi> element
contains a description of the taxonomy itself as well as an optional
bibliographic citation.  The description consists of a number of
<gi>category</gi> elements, each defining a single category within the
given typology.  The category is defined by the contents of a nested
<gi>catDesc</gi> element, which may contain either a phrase describing
the category, or a <gi>textDesc</gi> element defining it in terms of the
situational parameters discussed in section <ptr target="#CCAHTD"/>.  If the
category is subdivided, each subdivision is represented by a nested
<gi>category</gi> element, having the same structure.  Categories may be
nested to an arbitrary depth in order to reflect the hierarchical
structure of the taxonomy.  Each <gi>category</gi> element bears a
unique <att>xml:id</att> attribute, which is used as the target for
<gi>catRef</gi> elements referring to it.
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><taxonomy xml:id="b">
  <bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl>
  <category xml:id="b.a">
    <catDesc>Press Reportage</catDesc>
    <category xml:id="b.a1"><catDesc>Daily</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.a2"><catDesc>Sunday</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.a3"><catDesc>National</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.a4"><catDesc>Provincial</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.a5"><catDesc>Political</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.a6"><catDesc>Sports</catDesc></category>

    <category xml:id="b.d1"><catDesc>Books</catDesc></category>
    <category xml:id="b.d2"><catDesc>Periodicals and tracts</catDesc></category>
  </category>
  
</taxonomy></egXML></p>
<p>Linkage between a particular text and a category within such a
taxonomy is made by means of the <gi>catRef</gi> element within the
<gi>textClass</gi> element, as described in section <ptr target="#HD43"/>.  Where the taxonomy permits of classification along more
than one dimension, more than one category will be referenced by a
particular <gi>catRef</gi>, as in the following example, which
identifies a text with the sub-categories <q>Daily</q>, <q>National</q>
and <q>Political</q>, within the category <q>Press Reportage</q> as
defined above.
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#b.a1 #b.a3 #b.a5"/></egXML></p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section are defined as follows:
 
<specGrp xml:id="D2255" n="The classification declaration">&categorize.odd;
&clasdecl.odd;
&taxonomy.odd;
&category.odd;
&catdesc.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3><div3  xml:id="HDFSD"><head>The Feature System Declaration</head><p>The <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element is the seventh of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to
associate a <term>feature system declaration</term>  (as defined in
chapter <ptr target="#FD"/>) with any analytic <term>feature
structures</term> (as defined in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>) present in
the text documented by this header.</p>
<p>It has the following description and attributes:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="fsdDecl" />
</specList>
 
Note that one <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element must be specified for each
distinct type of feature structure used in the markup.  The
<att>url</att> element supplies a link to the  entity
containing a feature system declaration in which that type of feature
structure is defined (see further chapter <ptr target="#FD"/>). <!--
The external entity does not use the same DTD as the rest of the
document; it is recommended therefore to declare it as an unparsed
external entity using a foreign notation. The following document type subset for
the document shows how this may be achieved in either XML or SGML.

<code type="kw">SUBDOC</code> keyword to indicate that this
entity contains SGML data which can be parsed using some other DTD than
the current one. Since <code>SUBDOC</code> entities are not provided in XML, this
is not recommended for general usage.</note> 
This entity name may
then be specified within an <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element in the header to
inform a processor of the location of the feature system declaration
corresponding to a given type of feature structure used within the text,
as follows:-->The feature system declaration will typically be held in an external
entity, in much the same way as a file containing a graphic is
referenced by the <gi>graphic</gi> element. For example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
   <fileDesc>  </fileDesc>
   <encodingDesc>
      <fsdDecl type="myA1" url="http://fsd.com/myFeatures/"/>
      <fsdDecl type="myA2" url="http://fsd.com/myFeatures/"/>
   </encodingDesc>
   
</teiHeader></egXML>
 
This header would be attached to a text in which feature structures of
types <code type="value">myA1</code> and <code type="value">myA2</code> are
used. Definitions for the feature system in which these feature
structures are defined may be located at the URL stated above.</p>
<p>Further details and examples of the use of feature structure analyses
and feature system declarations are provided in chapters <ptr target="#FS"/> and <ptr target="#FD"/> respectively.</p>
<p>The <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element is declared as follows:
 
<specGrp xml:id="D2256" n="The FSD declaration">&fsddecl.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HDMN"><head>The Metrical Declaration Element</head>
<p>The <gi>metDecl</gi> element is the eighth of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to
document any metrical notation scheme used in the text, as further
discussed in section <ptr target="#VEME"/>. It consists either of
a prose description or a series of <gi>metSym</gi> elements.
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="metDecl" atts="pattern"/>
<specDesc key="metSym" atts="value terminal"/>
</specList></p>
<p>As with other components of the header, metrical notation may be
specified either formally or informally. In a formal specification,
every symbol used in the metrical notation must be documented by a
corresponding <gi>metSym</gi> element; in an informal one, only a brief
prose description of the way in which the notation is used need be
given. In either case, the optional <att>pattern</att> attribute may be
used to supply a regular expression which a processor can use to
validate expressions in the intended notation. The following
constraints apply:
 
<list type="simple">
		<item>if <att>pattern</att> is supplied, any notation used
		  which does not conform to it should be regarded as
		  invalid</item>
		<item>if any <gi>metSym</gi> is defined, then any notation
		  using undefined symbols should be regarded as
		  invalid</item>
		<item>if both pattern and symbol are defined, then every
		  symbol appearing explicitly within pattern must be
		  defined</item>
		<item>symbols which are not matched by <att>pattern</att> may
		  be defined within a <gi>metDecl</gi>
		  element</item>
</list></p><p>As a simple example, consider the case of the notation in which
metrical prominence, foot and line boundaries are all to be encoded.
Legal specifications in this notation may be written for any sequence of
metrically prominent or non-prominent features, optionally separated by
foot or metrical line boundaries at arbitrary points.  Assuming that the
symbol <mentioned>1</mentioned> is used for metrical prominence,
<mentioned>0</mentioned> for non-prominence, <mentioned>|</mentioned> for foot boundary
and <mentioned>/</mentioned> for line boundary, then the following declaration
achieves this object:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><metDecl pattern="((1|0)+\|?/?)*">
   <metSym value="1">metrical promimence</metSym>
   <metSym value="0">metrical non-prominence</metSym>
   <metSym value="|">foot boundary</metSym>
   <metSym value="/">metrical line boundary</metSym>
</metDecl></egXML></p>
<p>The same notation might also be specified less formally, as follows:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><metDecl>
  <p>Metrically prominent syllables are marked '1' and other
    syllables '0'. Foot divisions are marked by a vertical bar,
    and line divisions with a solidus.</p>
  <p>This notation may be applied to any metrical unit, of any
    size (including, for example, individual feet as well as
    groups of lines).</p>
</metDecl></egXML>
 
Note that in this case, because the <att>pattern</att> attribute has not
been supplied, no processor can validate <att>met</att> attribute values
within the text which use this metrical notation.</p><p>For more complex cases, it will often be more convenient to define
a notation incrementally. The <att>terminal</att> attribute should
be used to indicate for a given symbol whether or not it may be
re-defined in terms of other symbols used within the same notation.
For example, here is a notation for encoding classical metres, in
which symbols are provided for the most common types of foot.<!--
feet? -sb 2001-11-03 --> These symbols are themselves documented
within the same notation, in terms of more primitive long and short
syllables:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><metDecl pattern="[DTIS3A]+">
   <metSym n="dactyl" value="D" terminal="false">-oo</metSym>
   <metSym n="trochee" value="T" terminal="false">-o</metSym>
   <metSym n="iamb" value="I" terminal="false">o-</metSym>
   <metSym n="spondee" value="S" terminal="false">--</metSym>
   <metSym n="tribrach" value="3" terminal="false">ooo</metSym>
   <metSym n="anapaest" value="A" terminal="false">oo-</metSym>
   <metSym value="o">short syllable</metSym>
   <metSym value="-">long syllable</metSym>
</metDecl></egXML>
 
Note here the use of the global <att>n</att> attribute to supply an
additional name for the symbols being documented.</p>
<p>For further discussion of this metrical notation and its use in the
encoding of verse, see section <ptr target="#VEME"/>.</p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section are defined as follows:
 
<specGrp xml:id="D2258" n="Metrical Notation Declaration">
&metdecl.odd;
&metsym.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HDVAR"><head>The Variant-Encoding Method Element</head>
<p>The <gi>variantEncoding</gi> element is the last of the nine optional
subdivisions of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element.  It is used to
document the method used to encode textual variants in the text, as
discussed in section <ptr target="#TCAPLK"/>.
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="variantEncoding" atts="method location"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Its formal declaration is as follows:
 
<specGrp xml:id="DHDVAR" n="Variant-Encoding Declaration">&varencod.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3></div2>
<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD4"><head>The Profile Description</head>
<p>The <gi>profileDesc</gi> element is the third major subdivision of
the TEI Header. It is an optional element, the purpose of which is to
enable information characterizing various descriptive aspects of a text
or a corpus to be recorded within a single unified framework.
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="profileDesc"/>
</specList>
 
In principle, almost any component of the header might be of
importance as a means of characterizing a text.  The author of a written
text, its title or its date of publication, may all be regarded as
characterizing it at least as strongly as any of the parameters
discussed in this section.  The rule of thumb applied has been to
exclude from discussion here most of the information which generally
forms part of a standard bibliographic style description,
if only because such information has already been included
elsewhere in the TEI header.
</p>
<p>The core <gi>profileDesc</gi> element has three optional components,
represented by the following elements:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="creation"/>
<specDesc key="langUsage"/>
<specDesc key="textClass"/>
</specList>
These elements are further described in the remainder of this section.</p>
<p>Three other elements may also appear within the <gi>profileDesc</gi>
element, when the
corpus module is in use:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="textDesc"/>
<specDesc key="particDesc"/>
<specDesc key="settingDesc"/>
</specList>
 
For descriptions of these elements, see section <ptr target="#CCAH" type="div1"/>.</p>
<p>Finally, the following element can appear in the <gi>profileDesc</gi>
element, when the additional tag set for transcription of primary
sources is selected:
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="handList"/>
</specList>
 
For a description of this element, see section <ptr target="#PHDH"/>.</p>
<p>The profile description itself has the following formal definition:
 
<specGrp xml:id="D224" n="The profile description">
&profile.odd;
&profdesc.odd;
<specGrpRef target="#D224C"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2241"/>
<specGrpRef target="#D2243"/>
</specGrp></p>
<div3  xml:id="HD4C"><head>Creation</head>
<p>The <gi>creation</gi> element contains phrases describing the
origin of the text, e.g. the date and place of its composition.
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="creation"/>
</specList>
 
The date and place of composition are often of particular importance for
studies of linguistic variation; since such information cannot be
inferred with confidence from the bibliographic description of the copy
text, the <gi>creation</gi> element may be used to provide a consistent
location for this information:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><creation>    
   <date value="1992-08">August 1992</date>
   <rs type="city">Taos, New Mexico</rs>
</creation></egXML></p>
<p>The formal declaration of <gi>creation</gi> is as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="D224C" n="Creation">&creatn.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD41"><head>Language Usage</head>
<p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> element is used within the
<gi>profileDesc</gi> element to describe the languages, sublanguages,
registers, dialects, etc. represented within a text.  It contains one
or more <gi>language</gi> elements, each of which provides information
about a single language, notably the quantity of that language present
in the text.  Alternatively, it may contain paragraphs of prose
description specifying further relevant information. Note that this
element should <emph>not</emph> be used to supply information about
any non-standard characters or glyphs used by this language; such
information should be recorded in the <gi>charDesc</gi> element in
the encoding description (see further <ptr target="#WD"/>). 
 
<specList>
<specDesc key="langUsage"/>
<specDesc key="language" atts="usage"/>
</specList></p>
<p>A <gi>language</gi> element may be supplied for each different
language used in a document. If used, its <ident>xml:id</ident> attribute
should specify an appropriate language identifier, as further
discussed in section <ptr target="#CHSH"/>. This is particularly
important if extended language identifiers have been used as the
value of  <ident>xml:lang</ident> attributes elsewhere in the
document. </p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of this element:
<!--links the document to the formal
writing system declaration defining that language and its script; for
that reason, its use is recommended.
The <att>wsd</att> attribute must give the name of an entity containing a
writing system declaration; typically, this will be an external file
declared in the document type declaration. 
</p>
<p>When two sublanguages share the same language code and writing
system declaration but are distinguished in the <gi>langUsage</gi>
element, only one of the <gi>language</gi> elements should bear the
<att>xml:id</att> attribute:-->
<!-- I'm a bit hazy about the implications of that too: presumably -->
	<!-- all will be made clear in the wsd chapter? -->
	<!-- if not clear here, i doubt it will be clearer then. -msm -->
	<!-- The only implications I see are 1 that nothing in the    -->
	<!-- declarations can point at an individual sublanguage,     -->
	<!-- only to something that has its own WSD, 2 that any       -->
	<!-- processor which cares about identifying languages        -->
	<!-- (wsds) in use must be aware that some LANGUAGE           -->
	<!-- elements don't have IDs, and these must be ignored or    -->
	<!-- 'merged' somehow with LANGUAGE elements which do have    -->
	<!-- IDs and which use the same wsd.  -msm                    -->
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><langUsage>
   <language ident="fr-CA" usage="60">Qu&#xE9;becois</language>
   <language ident="en-CA" usage="20">Canadian business English</language>
   <language ident="en-GB" usage="20">British English</language>
</langUsage></egXML>
 
or, less formally,
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><langUsage>
<p> Approximately two-thirds of the text is in
    Qu&#xE9;becois, the remainder being equally
    divided between Canadian business English and
    British English.</p>
</langUsage></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> and <gi>language</gi> elements have the
following formal definitions:
<specGrp xml:id="D2241" n="Language usage">
&langusg.odd;
&language.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3>
<div3  xml:id="HD43"><head>The Text Classification</head>
<p>The second component of the core <gi>profileDesc</gi> element is the
<gi>textClass</gi> element. This element is used to classify a text
according to one or more of the following methods:
 
<list type="bullets">
<item>by reference to a recognized international classification such as
the Dewey Decimal Classification, the Universal Decimal Classification,
the Colon Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, or any
other system widely used in library and documentation work</item>
<item>by providing a set of keywords, as provided for example by British
Library or Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication data</item>
<item>by referencing any other taxonomy of text categories recognized in
the field concerned, or peculiar to the material in hand; this may
include one based on recurring sets of values for the situational
parameters defined in section <ptr target="#CCAHTD"/>, or the demographic
elements described in section <ptr target="#CCAHPA"/></item></list>
 
The last of these may be particularly important for dealing with
existing corpora or collections, both as a means of avoiding the expense
or inconvenience of reclassification and as a means of documenting
the organizing principles of such materials.</p>
<p>The following tags are provided for this purpose:
<specList>
<specDesc key="keywords" atts="scheme"/>
<specDesc key="classCode" atts="scheme"/>
<specDesc key="catRef" atts="target"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>keywords</gi> element simply categorizes an individual text
by supplying a list of keywords which may describe its topic or subject
matter, its form, date, etc.  In some schemes, the order of items in the
list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others,
the list has an organized substructure of its own.  No recommendations
are made here as to which method is to be preferred.  Wherever possible,
such keywords should be taken from a recognized source, such as the
British Library/Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication data in
the case of printed books, or a published thesaurus appropriate to the
field.</p>
<p>The <att>scheme</att> attribute should be used to indicate the source
of the keywords used.  This is done by supplying the value used for the
<att>xml:id</att> attribute of a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element within which
further details of the source concerned may be found.  The
<gi>taxonomy</gi> element occurs in the <gi>classDecl</gi> part of the
encoding declarations within the TEI Header and is described in
section <ptr target="#HD55"/>. For example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><keywords scheme="#lcsh">
   <list>
      <item>Data base management</item>
      <item>SQL (Computer program language)</item>
   </list>
</keywords></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><keywords scheme="#lcsh">
  <list>
    <item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Data processing.</item>
    <item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Theory, etc.</item>
    <item>English language -- Style -- Data processing.</item>
    <item>Style, Literary -- Data processing.</item>
  </list>
</keywords></egXML>
<!-- LC subject tracings on R Potter, ed., Literary           -->
	<!-- Computing and Literary Criticism:  Theoretical and       -->
	<!-- Practical Essays on Theme and Rhetoric (Philadelphia,    -->
	<!-- U Penn, 1989), from CIP data on title overleaf.          --></p>
<p>The <gi>classCode</gi> element also categorizes an individual text,
by supplying a numerical or other code used in a recognized
classification scheme, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification.  The
<att>scheme</att> attribute is used to indicate the source of the
classification scheme, in the same way as for the <gi>keywords</gi>
element, as in the following example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classCode scheme="#ddc19">005.756</classCode>
<classCode scheme="#lc">QA76.9</classCode></egXML>
<!-- subject classifications from Date, Guide to SQL Std      -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classCode scheme="#ddc19">820.285</classCode>
<classCode scheme="#lc">PR21</classCode></egXML>
<!-- subject classifications from Potter, Lit Comp & Lit Crit --></p>
<p>The <gi>catRef</gi> element categorizes an individual text by
pointing to one or more <gi>category</gi> elements.  The
<gi>category</gi> element (which is fully described in section <ptr target="#HD55"/>) holds information about a particular classification or
category within a given taxonomy.  Each such category must have a unique
identifier, which may be supplied as the value of the <att>target</att>
attribute for <gi>catRef</gi> elements which are regarded as falling
within the category indicated.</p>
<p>A text may, of course, fall into more than one category, in which
case more than one identifier will be supplied as the value for
the <att>target</att> attribute on the <gi>catRef</gi> element, as
in the following example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#B1 #B2 #B5"/></egXML></p>
<p>Where more than one descriptive taxonomy is used to characterize the
texts in a corpus or collection, the <att>scheme</att> attribute
should be supplied to specify the taxonomy to which the categories
identified by the target attribute belong. For example,
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#B12 #B15" scheme="brown.xml"/>
<catRef target="#A45" scheme="suc.xml"/></egXML>
 
Here the same text has been classified as of categories <q>B12</q> and
<q>B15</q> within the Brown classification scheme (presumed to be
available from <ident>brown.xml</ident>), and as of category
<q>A45</q> within the SUC classification scheme (presumed to be
available from <ident>suc.xml</ident>).</p>
<p>The distinction between the <gi>catRef</gi> and <gi>classCode</gi>
elements is that the values used as identifying codes <emph>must </emph>
be defined somewhere within the header for the former, but not the
latter.</p>
<p>The elements described in this section have the following formal
definitions:
<specGrp xml:id="D2243" n="Text Classification">
&textclas.odd;
&keywords.odd;
&classcod.odd;
&catref.odd;
</specGrp></p></div3></div2>
<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD6"><head>The Revision Description</head>
<p>The final subelement of the TEI header, the <gi>revisionDesc</gi>
element, provides a detailed change log in which each change made to a
text may be recorded.  Its use is optional but highly recommended.
It provides essential information for the administration of large
numbers of files which are being updated, corrected, or otherwise
modified as well as extremely useful documentation for files being
passed from researcher to researcher or system to system. Without
change logs, it is easy to confuse different versions of a file, or to
remain unaware of small but important changes made in the file by some
earlier link in the chain of distribution.  No change should be made in
any TEI-conformant file without corresponding entries being made in the
change log.<specList>
<specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
<specDesc key="change"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The main purpose of the revision description is to record changes
in the text to which a header is prefixed. However, it is recommended
TEI practice to include entries also for significant changes in the
header itself (other than the revision description itself, of
course). At the very least, an entry should be supplied indicating the
date of creation of the header.</p><p>The log consists of a list of entries, one for each change.  This
may be encoded using either the regular <gi>list</gi> element,
as described in section <ptr target="#COLI"/> or as a series of
special purpose <gi>change</gi> elements, each of which has
the following constituents:
<specList>
<specDesc key="date" />
<specDesc key="respStmt"/>
<specDesc key="item"/>
</specList>
The <gi>date</gi> element indicates the date of the change.
The <gi>respStmt</gi> element indicates who made the change, and in what
role.
The <gi>item</gi> element indicates what change was made; it can
range from a simple phrase to a series of paragraphs.
If a number is to be associated with one or more changes (for
example, a revision number), use the global <att>n</att>
attribute on the <gi>change</gi> element to supply it.
</p>
<p>It is recommended to give changes in reverse chronological order,
most recent first.	
	
	</p>
<p>For example:<!-- is this example perhaps not a bit over long? -->
	<!-- possibly, i just took a real one from a file -->
	<!-- it's now a little bit shorter; i extracted this from the -->
	<!-- WWP file elizabeth.godmed.sgml, and made some minor      -->
	<!-- changes -sb 2001-11-03  [from 66 to 51 lines]            -->

</egXML>
</p>
<p>The formal definition of the <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element is thus as
follows:<specGrp xml:id="D226" n="The Revision Description">&revdesc.odd;
&change.odd;
</specGrp>
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD7"><head>Minimal and Recommended Headers
 </head>
<p>The TEI header allows for the provision of a very large amount of
information concerning the text itself, its source, encodings
and revisions of it, as well as a wealth of descriptive information
such as the languages it uses and the situation within which it
was produced, the setting and identity of participants within it.
This diversity and richness reflects the diversity of uses to which
it is envisaged that electronic texts conforming to these Guidelines
will be put. It is emphatically <emph>not</emph> intended that all of the
elements described above should be present in every TEI Header.
 </p>
<p>The amount of encoding in a header will depend both on the nature
and the intended use of the text. At one extreme, an encoder may
expect that the header will be needed only to provide a bibliographic
identification of the text adequate to local needs. At the other,
wishing to ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range
of applications, encoders will want to document as explicitly as
possible both bibliographic and descriptive information, in such a
way that no prior or ancillary knowledge about the text is needed in
order to process it. The header in such a case will be very full,
approximating to  the kind of
documentation often supplied in the form of a manual. Most texts will
lie somewhere between these extremes; textual corpora in particular
will tend more to the latter extreme.	
In the remainder of this section we demonstrate first the minimal,
and next a commonly
recommended, level of encoding for the bibliographic information held by
the TEI header.
</p>
<p>Supplying only the minimal level of encoding required, the
TEI header of a single printed text might look like the following
example:
 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
  <fileDesc>
    <titleStmt>
      <title>Thomas Paine: Common sense, a
        machine-readable transcript</title>
      <respStmt>
        <resp>compiled by</resp>
        <name>Jon K Adams</name>
      </respStmt>
    </titleStmt>
    <publicationStmt>
      <distributor>Oxford Text Archive</distributor>
    </publicationStmt>
    <sourceDesc>
      <bibl>The complete writings of Thomas Paine, collected and edited
	    by Phillip S. Foner (New York, Citadel Press, 1945)</bibl>
    </sourceDesc>
  </fileDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML></p><p>The only mandatory component of the TEI Header is the
<gi>fileDesc</gi> element.  Within this, <gi>titleStmt</gi>,
<gi>publicationStmt</gi>, and <gi>sourceDesc</gi> are all required
constituents.  Within the title statement, a title is required, and an
author should be specified, even if it is <mentioned>unknown</mentioned>, as
should some additional statement of responsibility, here given by the
<gi>respStmt</gi> element. Within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>, a
publisher, distributor or other agency responsible for the file must be
specified.  Finally, the source description should contain at the least
a loosely structured bibliographic citation identifying the source of
the electronic text if (as is usually the case) there is one.
 </p>
<p>We now present the same example header, expanded to include
additionally recommended information, adequate to most bibliographic
purposes, in particular to allow for the creation of an AACR2-conformant
bibliographic record.  We have also added information about the
encoding principles used in this (imaginary) encoding, about the
text itself (in the form of Library of Congress subject headings),
and about the revision of the file.

<div2 type="bar" xml:id="HD8"><head>Note for Library Cataloguers</head><p>A strong motivation in preparing the material in this chapter was to
provide in the TEI file header a viable chief source of information
for cataloguing the machine-readable data file.  The file header is not
a library catalogue record, and so will not make all of the distinctions
essential in standard library work.  It also includes much information
generally excluded from standard bibliographic descriptions.  It is the
intention of the developers, however, to ensure that the information
required for a catalogue record be retrievable from the TEI file
header, and moreover that the mapping from the one to the other be as
simple and straightforward as possible.  Where the correspondence is not
obvious, it may prove useful to consult one of the works which were
influential in developing the content of the TEI file header.  These
include:<list type="gloss"><label>ISBD(G) </label>
<item>The International Standard Book Description
(General) is an international standard setting out what information
should be recorded in a description of a bibliographical item.  There
are also separate ISBDs covering different types of material, e.g.
ISBD(M) for monographs, ISBD(CF) for computer files.  These separate
ISBDs follow the same general scheme as the main ISBD(G), but provide
appropriate interpretations for the specific materials under
consideration.
</item><label>AACR2 </label>
<item>The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (second edition)
were published in 1978, with a revision appearing in 1988.  The AACR2
provides guidelines for the construction of catalogues in general
libraries.  AACR2 is explicitly based on the general framework of the
ISBD(G), and the subsidiary ISBDs.  It gives a description of how to
catalogue items according to the ISBDs, and how to construct indexes and
catalogue cross references.
</item><label>ANSI Z.39.29 </label>
<item>ANSI Z.39.29 is an American national standard
governing bibliographic references for use in bibliographies,
end-of-work lists, references in abstracting and indexing publications,
and outputs from computerized bibliographic data bases.  This standard
has however now been withdrawn, pending substantial revision.  The
international standard which covers the same area is ISO 690:1987.
Other relevant standards include BS 1629:1989, BS 5605:1978, and BS
6371:1983.
