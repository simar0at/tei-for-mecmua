married a second time,</q> replied Thjostolf.</p>

  <remarks>
    <p>In some contexts, the paragraph may have a specialized
meaning, e.g. in the tag set for dictionaries, <gi>p</gi> is used to
enclose any running text, and thus does not imply text set off as is
conventionally done in running prose.</p>
