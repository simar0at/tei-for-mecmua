<div1 xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="Chapter" xml:id="CO" n="6"><head>Elements Available in All TEI Documents</head>
<p>This chapter describes elements which may appear in any kind of text
and the tags used to mark them in all TEI documents. Most of these
elements are freely floating phrases, which can appear at any point
within the textual structure, although they must generally be contained
by a higher-level element of some kind (such as a paragraph). A few of
the elements described in this chapter (for example, bibliographic
citations and lists) have a comparatively well-defined internal
structure, but most of them have no consistent inner structure of their
own. In the general case, they contain only a few words, and are often
identifiable in a conventionally printed text by the use of typographic
conventions such as shifts of font, use of quotation or other
punctuation marks, or other changes in layout.</p>
<p>This chapter begins by describing the <gi>p</gi> tag used to mark
paragraphs, which serve as the fundamental formal unit for running text
in many base tag sets, and are available in all. This is followed, in
section <ptr target="#COPU"/>, by a discussion of some specific problems
associated with the interpretation of conventional punctuation, and the
methods proposed by the current Guidelines for resolving ambiguities
therein.</p>
<p>The next section (section <ptr target="#COHQ"/>) describes a number
of phrase-level elements commonly marked by typographic features (and
thus well-represented in conventional markup languages). These include
features commonly marked by font shifts (section <ptr target="#COHQH"/>) and features commonly marked by quotation marks
(section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>) as well as such features as terms,
cited words, and glosses (section <ptr target="#COHQU"/>).</p>
<p>Section <ptr target="#COED"/> introduces some phrase-level elements
which may be used to record simple editorial emendation or correction of
the encoded text. The tags described here constitute a simple subset of
the full mechanisms for encoding such information (described in full in
chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>), which should be adequate to most commonly
encountered situations.</p>
<p>The next section (section <ptr target="#CONA"/>) describes several
phrase-level and inter-level elements which, although often of
interest for analysis or processing, are rarely explicitly identified
in conventional printing. These include names (section <ptr target="#CONARS" type="div2"/>), numbers and measures (section <ptr target="#CONANU" type="div2"/>), dates and times (section <ptr target="#CONADA" type="div2"/>), abbreviations (section <ptr target="#CONAAB" type="div2"/>), and addresses (section <ptr target="#CONAAD"/>).</p>
<p>In the same way, the following section (section <ptr target="#COXR"/>) presents only a subset of the facilities available
for the encoding of cross-references or text-linkage. The full story
may be found in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>; the tags presented here
are intended to be usable for a wide variety of simple
applications.</p>
<p>Sections <ptr target="#COLI"/>, and <ptr target="#CONO"/>, describe
two kinds of quasi-structural elements, lists and notes, which may
appear either within chunk-level elements such as paragraphs, or
between them. Several kinds of lists are catered for, of an arbitrary
complexity. The section on notes discusses both notes found in the
source and simple mechanisms for adding annotations of an interpretive
nature during the encoding; again, only a subset of the facilities
described in full elsewhere (specifically, in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>) is discussed.</p>
<p>Section <ptr target="#COGR"/> introduces some simple ways of
representing graphic or other non-textual content found in a text. A
fuller discussion of the multimedia facilities supported by these
Guidelines may be found in chapters <ptr target="#FT"/> and <ptr target="#SA"/>. </p>
<p>Next, section <ptr target="#CORS" type="div2"/>, describes methods of
encoding within a text the conventional system or systems used when
making references to the text. Some reference systems have attained
canonical authority and must be recorded to make the text useable in
normal work; in other cases, a convenient reference system must be
created by the creator or analyst of an electronic text.</p>
<p>Like lists and notes, the bibliographic citations discussed in
section <ptr target="#COBI"/>, may be regarded as structural elements in
their own right. A range of possibilities is presented for the encoding
of bibliographic citations or references, which may be treated as
simple phrases within a running text, or as highly-structured
components suitable for inclusion in a bibliographic database.</p>
<p>Additional elements for the encoding of passages of verse or drama
(whether prose or verse) are discussed in section <ptr target="#CODV"/>.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with a technical overview of the structure and
organization of the tag set described here. This should be read in
conjunction with chapter <ptr target="#ST"/>, describing the structure of
the TEI document type definition.</p> 
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COPA"><head>Paragraphs</head>
<p>The paragraph is the fundamental organizational unit for all prose
texts, being the smallest regular unit into which prose can be
divided. Prose can appear in all TEI texts, even those that are
primarily of another genre (e.g., verse); thus the paragraph is
described here, as an element which can appear in any kind of
text.</p>
<p>Paragraphs can contain any of the other elements described within
this chapter, as well as some other elements which are specific to
individual text types. We distinguish <term>phrase-level</term>
elements, which must be entirely contained within a paragraph and
cannot appear except within one, from <term>chunks</term>, which can
appear between, but not within, paragraphs, and from
<term>inter-level</term> elements, which can appear either within a
single paragraph or between paragraphs. The class of phrases includes
emphasized or quoted phrases, names, dates, etc. The class of
inter-level elements includes bibliographic citations, notes, lists,
etc. The class of chunks includes the paragraph itself, and other
elements which have similar structural properties, notably the
<gi>ab</gi> (anonymous block) element described in <ptr target="#SASE"/>) which may be used as an alternative to the paragraph
in some kinds of texts.</p>
<p>Because paragraphs may appear in different base or additional tag
sets, their possible contents may differ in different kinds of
documents. In particular, additional elements not listed in this
chapter may appear in paragraphs in certain kinds of text. However, the
elements described in this chapter are always by default available in
all kinds of text.</p>
<p>The paragraph is marked using the <gi>p</gi> element:
 <specList><specDesc key="p"/></specList></p>
<p>If a consistent internal subdivision of paragraphs is desired, the
<gi>s</gi> or <gi>seg</gi> (<soCalled>segment</soCalled>) elements may
be used, as discussed in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/> and <ptr target="#AI"/>
respectively. More usually, however, paragraphs have no firm internal
structure, but contain prose encoded as a mix of characters, entity
references, phrases marked as described in the rest of this chapter, and
embedded elements like lists, figures, or tables.</p>
<p>Since paragraphs are usually explicitly marked in Western texts,
typically by indentation, the application of the <gi>p</gi> tag
usually presents few problems.</p>
<p>In some cases, the body of a text may comprise but a single
paragraph:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body>
   <p>I fully appreciate Gen. Pope's splendid achievements with their
invaluable results; but you must know that Major Generalships in the
Regular Army, are not as plenty as blackberries.</p>
</body></egXML>

	<!-- Library of America, Lincoln, v. 2 p. 315.                -->
 </p>
<p>This news story shows typically short journalistic paragraphs:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head>SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 19</head>

<p>A special envoy from the European Community, Colin Doyle, harshly
  condemned the decision by Serbs to shell Sarajevo on Saturday night
  during a visit to the Bosnian capital by a senior American official,

<p>...</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The following extract from a Russian fairy tale demonstrates
how other phrase level elements (in this case <gi>q</gi> elements
representing direct speech; see section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>)
may be nested within, but not across, paragraphs:
<!-- < citation>< title>Russian Fairy Tales,< /title>         -->

	<!-- changed.  (msm)                                          -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>A fly built a castle, a tall and mighty castle.
There came to the castle the Crawling Louse. <q>Who,

 </p>
<p>The <gi>p</gi> element is formally declared as follows:

&p.odd;
</specGrp>
</p> 
</div2>
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COPU"><head>Treatment of Punctuation</head>
<p>Punctuation marks cause problems for text markup because they may
not be available in the character set used and because they are often
ambiguous. In the former case entity names should be used to render
the punctuation mark (see <ptr target="#CH" type="div1"/>). In the latter
case, ambiguous punctuation may be treated as described below.
 </p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Full stop (period)</term><index><term>full stop</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index><index><term>period</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
may mark (orthographic) sentence boundaries, abbreviations, decimal
points, or serve as a visual aid in printing numbers. These usages can
be distinguished by tagging S-units, abbreviations, and numbers, as
described in sections <ptr target="#SASE"/>, <ptr target="#CONAAB"/>,
and <ptr target="#CONANU"/>. There are independent reasons for tagging these,
whether or not they are marked by full stops. Alternatively,
entity names like the following might be used to distinguish stops
(and other characters) used for these purposes:
<list type="gloss"><label>stop.abbr </label>
<item>a stop used to end an abbreviation</item><label>stop.sent </label>
<item>a stop used to end a sentence</item><label>stop.abse </label>
<item>a stop used both to end an abbreviation
                        and to end a sentence</item><label>stop.dec  </label>
<item>a stop used as a decimal point</item><label>comma.dec </label>
<item>a comma used as a decimal point</item><label>middot.dec </label>
<item>a midline dot used as a decimal point</item><label>stop.space </label>
<item>a stop used as a numeric space character</item><label>comma.space </label>
<item>a comma used as a numeric space character</item></list>
 </p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Question mark</term><index><term>question mark</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
and <term rend="noindex">exclamation mark</term><index><term>exclamation mark</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
typically mark the end of orthographic sentences, but may also be used
as a mid-sentence comment by the author (<mentioned>!</mentioned> to express
surprise or some other strong feeling, <mentioned>?</mentioned> to query a word
or expression or mark a sentence as dubious in linguistic discussion).
These uses may be distinguished by marking S-units, in which case the
mid-sentence uses of these punctuation marks may be left unmarked.
 </p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Hyphens</term><index><term>hyphen</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index><index><term>hyphen</term><index><term>soft and hard</term></index></index>
 at line-end may or may not indicate permanent
 (<soCalled>hard</soCalled>) hyphens in the word. Where the lineation
 of the machine-readable text differs from the original, the editor
 may either eliminate non-significant line-end hyphens or replace them by a reference
 to an appropriate character entity.<note place="foot"><ident type="ge">shy</ident> (<soCalled>soft
 hyphen</soCalled>) is defined in the standard public entity
 set <ident type="entset">ISOnum</ident>; Unicode reserves code point
 2010 for the
 hyphen, and 2011 for the <soCalled>non-breaking</soCalled> hyphen.</note>
 Whichever method is adopted, it should be
 reported using the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element within the encoding
 declarations in the TEI header. See chapter <ptr target="#HD" type="div1"/> for discussion of the TEI header and encoding
 declarations.</p> 
<p>When creating a machine-readable text from scratch, it is best not
 to introduce hyphenation simply to make lines of a predefined
 length, since  one cannot then easily tell whether the
 hyphens are soft or hard. When compounds or prefixed words
 are  hyphenated in mid-sentence, it may be impossible to tell whether the
 hyphenation is due to formatting or to linguistic concerns. </p>
 <p><term rend="noindex">Dashes</term><index><term>dash</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> are best distinguished in form by using the
 entity names provided in the public entity set <ident type="entset">ISOpub</ident>, defined in ISO 8879: <ident type="ge">mdash</ident>, <ident type="ge">ndash</ident>, and <ident type="ge">dash</ident> (the <soCalled>true</soCalled>
 hyphen). Alternatively, in a standalone
 XML context, these entities may be represented as Unicode
 characters <code>&amp;#x2014;</code>, <code>&amp;#x2013;</code>,
 or <code>&amp;#x2010;</code> respectively.
 Dashes are used for a variety of purposes: insertion, interruption,
 new speaker (in dialogue), list item. In the latter two cases it is
 preferable to mark the underlying feature using the elements <tag>q</tag> or <tag>item</tag>, on which see section <ptr target="#COHQQ" type="div2"/>, and section <ptr target="#COLI" type="div2"/>,
 respectively.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Quotation marks</term><index><term>quotation   marks</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> should generally be replaced by the tags
  <tag>q</tag> or <tag>quote</tag>, especially as quotations are not
  always marked by quotation marks (notably long quotations) or may be
  marked in a variety of ways; see the discussion of quotation and
  related features in section <ptr target="#COHQQ" type="div1"/>.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Apostrophes</term><index><term>apostrophe</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> must be distinguished from single quote marks.
 This is best done by tagging quotations or other uses of quotation
 marks (see above). However, apostrophes have a variety of uses. In
 English they mark contractions, genitive forms, and (occasionally)
 plural forms. Full disambiguation of these uses belongs to the level
 of linguistic analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Parentheses</term><index><term>parentheses</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> and other marks of suspension such as dashes or
 ellipses are often used to signal information about the syntactic
 structure of a text fragment. Full disambiguation of their uses also
 belongs to the level of linguistic analysis and interpretation, and
 is therefore discussed in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>.
</p>
<p>Where punctuation marks are disambiguated by tagging the underlying
feature they signal, it may be debated whether they should be excluded
or left as part of the text. In the case of quotation marks, it may
sometimes be more convenient to distinguish opening from closing marks
simply by using the appropriate entity reference, rather than using the
<gi>q</gi> element, with or without a <att>rend</att> attribute. The
solution chosen will vary depending upon the feature and depending upon
the purpose of the project.
</p> 
</div2>
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COHQ"><head>Highlighting and Quotation</head>
<p>This section deals with a variety of textual features, all of
which have in common that they are frequently realized in conventional
printing practice by the use of such features as underlining, italic
fonts, or quotation marks, collectively referred to here as
<term>highlighting</term>. After an initial discussion of this
phenomenon and alternate approaches to encoding it, this section
describes ways of encoding the following textual features, all
of which are conventionally rendered using some kind of highlighting:
<list type="simple">
<item>emphasis, foreign words and other linguistically distinct uses
of highlighting</item>
<item>representation of speech and thought, quotation, etc.</item>
<item>technical terms, glosses, etc.</item></list>
 </p>
<div3 type="burp" xml:id="COHQW"><head>What Is Highlighting?</head>
<p>By <mentioned>highlighting</mentioned> we mean the use of any combination of<index><term>highlighting</term></index>
 typographic features (font, size, hue,
etc.) in a printed or written text in order to distinguish some passage
of a text from its surroundings.<note place="foot">Although the way in which a spoken
text is performed, (for example, the voice quality, loudness, etc.)
might be regarded as analogous to <soCalled>highlighting</soCalled> in
this sense, these Guidelines recommend distinct elements for the
encoding of such <soCalled>highlighting</soCalled> in spoken texts. See
further section <ptr target="#TSSASH"/>.</note> The purpose of highlighting
is generally to draw the reader's attention to some feature or
characteristic of the passage highlighted; this section describes the
elements recommended by these Guidelines for the encoding of such
textual features.
 </p>
<p>In conventionally printed modern texts, highlighting is often
employed to identify words or phrases which are regarded as being one or
more of the following:
<list type="bullets">
<item>distinct in some way &#x2014; as foreign, dialectal,
archaic, technical, etc.</item>
<item>emphatic, and which would for example be stressed when spoken</item>
<item>not part of the body of the text, for example cross references,
titles, headings, labels, etc.</item>
<item>identified with a distinct narrative stream, for example an
internal monologue or commentary.</item>
<item>attributed by the narrator to some other agency, either within the
text or outside it:  for example, direct speech or quotation.</item>
<item>set apart from the text in some other way:  for example,
proverbial phrases, words mentioned but not used, names of persons and
places in older texts, editorial corrections or additions, etc.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>The textual functions signalled by highlighting may not be rendered
consistently in different parts of a text or in different texts. (For
example, a foreign word may appear in italics if the surrounding text is
in roman, but in roman if the surrounding text is in italics.)  For this
reason, these Guidelines distinguish between the encoding of rendering
itself and the encoding of the underlying feature expressed by it.
 </p>
<p>Highlighting as such may be encoded by using the global
<att>rend</att> attribute which can be specified for any element in the
TEI scheme. This allows the encoder both to specify the function of a
highlighted phrase or word, by selecting the appropriate element
described here or elsewhere in the Guidelines, and to further describe
the way in which it is highlighted, by means of the <att>rend</att>
attribute. If the encoder wishes to offer no interpretation of the
feature underlying the use of highlighting in the source text, then the
<gi>hi</gi> element may be used, which indicates only that the text so
tagged was highlighted in some way.
 </p>
<p>The possible values carried by the <att>rend</att> attribute are not
formally defined in this version of the Guidelines. Since the
<att>rend</att> attribute may be used to document any peculiarity of the
way a given segment of text was rendered in the original source text, it
may need to express a very large range of typographic features, by no
means restricted to type face, type size, etc.
 </p>
<p>Where it is both appropriate and feasible, these Guidelines recommend
that the textual feature marked by the highlighting should be encoded,
rather than just the simple fact of the highlighting. This is for the
following reasons:
<list type="simple">
<item>the same kind of highlighting may be used for different purposes
in different contexts</item>
<item>the same textual function may be highlighted in different ways in
different contexts</item>
<item>for analytic purposes, it is in general more useful to know the
intended function of a highlighted phrase than simply that it is
distinct.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>In many, if not most, cases the underlying function of a highlighted
phrase will be obvious and non-controversial, since the distinctions
indicated by a change of highlighting correspond with distinctions
discussed elsewhere in these Guidelines. It should be recognized,
however, that cases do exist in which it is not economically feasible to
mark the underlying function of highlighting (e.g. in the preparation of
large text corpora), as well as cases in which it is not intellectually
appropriate (as in the transcription of some older materials, or in the
preparation of material for the study of typographic practice). In such
cases, the <gi>hi</gi> element should be used, as further discussed
below.
 </p>
<p>Elements which are sometimes realized by typographic distinction but
which are not discussed in this section include <gi>title</gi>
(discussed in section <ptr target="#COBI"/>) and <gi>name</gi> (discussed
in section <ptr target="#CONARS"/>).
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="burp" xml:id="COHQH"><head>Emphasis, Foreign Words, and Unusual Language</head>
<p>This subsection discusses the following elements:
<specList><specDesc key="foreign"/><specDesc key="emph"/><specDesc key="hi"/><specDesc key="distinct"/></specList>
 </p>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COHQHF"><head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head>
<p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the text
should be tagged as such, at least where the fact is indicated in the
text. Where the word or phrase concerned is already distinguished from
the rest of the text by virtue of its function (for example, because it
is a name, a technical term, a quotation, a mentioned word, etc.) then
the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute should be used to specify
additionally that its language distinguishes it from the surrounding
text. Any element in the TEI scheme may take a <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute, which specifies both the writing system and the language used
by its content (see section <ptr target="#CHSH"/> for discussion of this
attribute). Where there is no other applicable element, the tag
<tag>foreign</tag> may be used to provide a peg onto which the
<att>xml:lang</att> may be attached.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>Aren't you confusing <foreign xml:lang="la">post hoc</foreign>
with <foreign xml:lang="la">propter hoc</foreign>?</q> said the Bee 
Master. <q>Wax-moth only succeed when weak bees let them in.</q></egXML>
<!-- R Kipling 'The mother hive' in Actions and Reactions, 1909 -->
	<!-- these could be tagged as TERM, of course. -MSM -->
 </p>
<p>The <tag>foreign</tag> tag should not be used to encode foreign words
which are mentioned or glossed within the text:  for these use the
appropriate element from section <ptr target="#COHQU"/> below. Compare the
following example sentences:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">John eats a <foreign xml:lang="fr">croissant</foreign> every morning.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><mentioned xml:lang="fr">Croissant</mentioned> is difficult to
pronounce with your mouth full.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">A <term xml:lang="fr">croissant</term> is a crescent-shaped
piece of light, buttery, pastry that is usually eaten for
breakfast, especially in France.</egXML>
<!-- Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary, ed. John    -->
	<!-- Sinclair (London and Glasgow:  Collins, 1987), p. 337    -->
	<!-- s.v. croissant.                                          -->
 </p>
<p>The <gi>foreign</gi> element is formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOHQ" n="Highlighted phrases">
&foreign.odd;
<specGrpRef target="#DCOHQ1"/><specGrpRef target="#DCOHQ3"/><specGrpRef target="#DCOHQQ"/><specGrpRef target="#DCOHQU"/></specGrp>
 </p></div4>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COHQHE"><head>Emphatic Words and Phrases</head>
<p>The <gi>emph</gi> element is provided to mark words or phrases which
are <emph>linguistically</emph> emphatic or stressed. Text which is
only typographically <soCalled>emphasized</soCalled> falls into the
class of highlighted text, and may be tagged with the <gi>hi</gi>
element. In printed works, emphasis is generally indicated by devices
such as the use of an italic font, a large typeface or extra wide letter
spacing; in manuscripts and typescripts, it is usually indicated by the
use of underlining.
As the following examples demonstrate, an encoder may choose whether or
not to make explicit the particular type of rendition associated with
the emphasis, by use of the <att>rend</att> attribute. If a source text
consistently renders a particular feature (e.g. emphasis or words in
foreign languages) in a particular way, the rendering associated with
that feature may be described in the TEI header and the <att>rend</att>
attribute used only to describe examples which deviate from the norm.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>Sex, sir, is <emph>purely</emph> a
question of appetite!</q> Tarr exclaimed.</egXML>
<!-- Wyndham Lewis, Tarr (1928), Jupiter ed 1968, p.17 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>What it all comes to is this,</q><![CDATA[ he said.
]]><q><emph rend="italic">What does Christopher
Robin do in the morning nowadays?</emph></q></egXML>
<!-- Milne, House at Pooh Corner (1928), p83 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>Here Thou, great <name rend="italics">Anna</name>!
   whom three Realms obey,</l>
<l>Doth sometimes Counsel take &#x2014;
   and sometimes <emph rend="italic">Tea</emph>.</l></egXML>
<!-- Pope, Rape of the Lock (1744) III.8 -->
 </p>
<p>The <gi>hi</gi> element is used to mark words or phrases which are
highlighted in some way, but for which identification of the intended
distinction is difficult, controversial or impossible. It enables an
encoder simply to record the fact of highlighting, possibly describing
it by the use of a <att>rend</att> attribute, as discussed above,
without however taking a position as to the function of the
highlighting. This may also be useful if the text is to be processed in
two stages:  representing simply typographic distinctions during a first
pass, and then replacing the <tag>hi</tag> tags with more specific tags
in a second pass.
 </p>
<p>Some simple examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><hi rend="gothic">And this Indenture further witnesseth</hi><![CDATA[
that the said ]]><hi rend="italic">Walter Shandy</hi><![CDATA[, merchant,
in consideration of the said intended marriage ...]]></egXML>
<!-- Sterne, Tristram Shandy (1760), p.82 -->
In this example, the first highlighted phrase uses black letter or

 </p>
<p>The <gi>emph</gi> and <gi>hi</gi> elements are formally defined as
follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOHQ1">
&emph.odd;
&hi.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div4>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COHQHD"><head>Other Linguistically Distinct Material</head>
<p>For some kinds of analysis, it may be desirable to encode the
linguistic distinctiveness of words and phrases with more delicacy than
is allowed by the <gi>foreign</gi> element. The <gi>distinct</gi>
element is provided for this purpose. Its attributes allow for
additional information characterizing the nature of the linguistic
distinction to be made in two distinct ways:  the <att>type</att>
attribute simply assigns a user-defined code of some kind to the word or
phrase which assigns it to some register, sub-language, etc. No
recommendations as to the set of values for this attribute are provided
at this time, as little consensus exists in the field.
 </p>
<p>Alternatively, the remaining three attributes may be used in
combination to place a word or phrase on a three-dimensional scale
sometimes used in descriptive linguistics.<note place="foot">See, for example,
<bibl><title>Sociolinguistics/Soziolinguistik (An international
handbook of the science of language and society. Ein internationales
Handbuch zur Wissenschaft von Sprache und Gesellschaft)</title> (Berlin,
New York:  De Gruyter, 1988), I, pp. 271 and 274.</bibl></note>
The <att>time</att> attribute places a word
<term rend="noindex">diachronically</term>,<index><term>diachronic information</term></index>
for example as archaic, old-fashioned, contemporary, futuristic, etc.;
the <att>space</att> attribute places a word
<term rend="noindex">diatopically</term>,<index><term>diatopic information</term></index>
that is, with respect to a geographical classification, for example as
national, regional, international, etc.; the <att>social</att> attribute
places a word <term rend="noindex">diastatically</term>,<index><term>diastatic information</term></index>
that is, with respect to a social classification, for example as
technical, polite, impolite, restricted, etc. Again, no recommendations
are made for the values of these attributes at this time; the encoder
should provide a description of the scheme used in the appropriate
section of the header (see section <ptr target="#HD5"/>).
 </p>
<p>Examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Next morning a boy in that dormitory confided to his
bosom friend, a <distinct type="psSlang">fag</distinct> of
Macrea's, that there was trouble in their midst which

<!-- Kipling, Stalky & Co. (1899), Library ed 1950, p.83) -->

King <distinct time="archaic">would fain</distinct> keep
secret.</egXML>
Where more complex (or more rigorous) interpretive analyses of the
associations of a word are required, the more detailed and general
mechanisms described in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/> should be preferred to
these simple characterizations. It may also be preferable to record the
kinds of analysis suggested here by means of the simple annotation
element <gi>note</gi> described in section <ptr target="#CONO"/>, or the
<gi>span</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#AISP"/>.
 </p>
<p>The <gi>distinct</gi> element has the following formal definition:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOHQ3">
&distinct.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div4></div3>
<div3 type="burp" xml:id="COHQQ"><head>Quotation</head>
<p>This section discusses the following elements, all of which are often
rendered by the use of quotation marks:
<specList><specDesc key="q"/><specDesc key="quote"/>
<specDesc key="cit"/>
<specDesc key="mentioned"/>
<specDesc key="soCalled"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>One form of presentational variation found particularly frequently in
written and printed texts is the use of quotation marks. As with the
typographic variations discussed in the preceding section, it is
generally helpful to separate the encoding of the underlying textual
feature (for example, a quotation or a piece of direct speech) from the
encoding of its rendering (for example, the use of a particular style of
quotation marks).
 </p>
<p>The most common and important use of quotation marks is, of course,
to mark <term>quotation</term>, by which we mean simply any part of the
text attributed by the author or narrator to some agency other than the
narrative voice. Typical examples include passages cited from other
works, for which the element <gi>quote</gi> may be used, and words or
phrases attributed to other voices within the current work, for which
the element <gi>q</gi> may be used. If this distinction between
intra-textual and inter-textual voices cannot be made reliably, or is
not of interest, then all quoted matter may simply be marked using the
<gi>q</gi> tag. The editorial policy in this respect should be stated
in the encoding description of the TEI Header. The <gi>soCalled</gi>
element is used for cases where the author or narrator distances him or
herself from the words in question without however attributing them to
any other voice in particular.
 </p>
<p>Quotation may be rendered by changes in type face, by special
punctuation marks (single or double or angled quotes, dashes, etc.) and
by layout (indented paragraphs, etc.). If these characteristics are of
interest, an appropriate value for the <att>rend</att> attribute should
be given, to record how the <gi>q</gi> or <gi>quote</gi> element is
rendered. For discussion of suggested values for this attribute, see
below.
  </p>
<p>Quotation marks themselves may, like other punctuation marks, be
felt for some purposes to be worth retaining within a text, quite
independently of their description by the <att>rend</att> attribute.
Where this is done, either an appropriate entity reference may be
chosen from the standard ISO entity sets defined by ISO 8879,<note>ISO
8879-1986 (E) Annex D.4; see Goldfarb, p. 502. XML versions are
available at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Entity_Sets/Unicode/iso-tech.ent"/>.</note>
or the character code points may be entered either directly or as
numeric character references. An entity reference has the advantage
that the entity may be redefined as null when the punctuation is to be
ignored for some analytic purpose. Well-known ambiguities, such as
whether the character ' represents an apostrophe or a closing single
quotation mark, or whether the character " represents an opening or
closing double quotation mark may all be resolved by the use of
appropriate entity references, as discussed in section <ptr target="#COPU"/>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the encoder may suppress all quotation marks, possibly
recording their form using the <att>rend</att> attribute. Where this is
done, the following list of entity names (taken from the public entity
sets <ident type="entset">ISOpub</ident> and <ident type="entset">ISOnum</ident>) may be found useful to describe
quotation-mark styles common in European and American typesetting:
<!-- list restored under (mild) protest and with one necessary  -->
	<!-- addition                                     LB, oct 92    -->
<list type="gloss"><label>ldquo  </label>
<item>double inverted comma (shaped like 66, superscript)</item><label>lsquo  </label>
<item>single inverted comma (shaped like 6, superscript)</item><label>rdquo  </label>
<item>double apostrophe (shaped like 99, superscript)</item><label>rsquo  </label>
<item>single apostrophe (shaped like 9, superscript)</item><label>ldquor </label>
<item>double comma (shaped like 99, printed on base line)</item><label>lsquor </label>
<item>single comma (shaped like 9, printed on base line)</item><label>laquo  </label>
<item>double guillemet open to the right</item><label>lsaquo </label>
<item>single guillemet open to the right</item><label>raquo  </label>
<item>double guillemet open to the left</item><label>rsaquo </label>
<item>single guillemet open to the left</item><label>mdash  </label>
<item>dash the width of a lowercase <mentioned>m</mentioned></item></list>
<!-- J.Lavagnino suggests revisiting the issue of mdash in    -->
	<!-- P4:  perhaps this is too print-centered?  (msm)          -->
These may be used in the <att>rend</att> attribute to show how the
quotation was opened and closed. For example, if the words
<mentioned>pre</mentioned> and <mentioned>post</mentioned> are used to indicate
preceding and following punctuation, then the following example would
describe a conventional American book printed using single quotation
marks:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q rend="PRE lsquo POST rsquo">Who-e debel
you?</q><![CDATA[ — he at last said — 
]]><q rend="PRE lsquo POST rsquo">you no speak-e,
damme, I kill-e.</q><![CDATA[  And so saying,
the lighted tomahawk began flourishing
about me in the dark.]]></egXML>
<!-- Melville, Moby Dick (but where?) -->
The following example demonstrates alternative policies which may be
adopted with respect to encoding of the punctuation used to mark
quotation:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Adolphe se tourna vers lui :
<q>— Alors, Albert, quoi de neuf?</q>
   <q>— Pas grand-chose.</q>
   <q>— Il fait beau,</q> dit Robert.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Adolphe se tourna vers lui :
<q rend="PRE mdash">Alors, 
     Albert, quoi de neuf ?</q>
   <q rend="PRE mdash">Pas grand-chose.</q>
   <q rend="PRE mdash">Il fait beau,</q>
     dit Robert.</egXML>
<!-- Queneau, Exercices de style (1947) p.192 -->
To make explicit who is speaking, which is not always stated in the
above example, the <att>who</att> attribute should be used:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Adolphe se tourna vers lui :
<q who="Adolphe">— Alors, Albert,
 quoi de neuf?</q>
<q who="Albert">— Pas grand-chose.</q>
<q who="Robert">— Il fait beau,</q>
 dit Robert.</egXML>
<!-- should show QUOTATION declarations for these -->
The <att>who</att> attribute is also useful as a means of supplying a
normalized form of the speaker's name, to facilitate selection of text
by particular speakers. As indicated above, it may be supplied whether
or not an indication of the speaker is given explicitly in the text.
 </p>
<p>Where investigation of <soCalled>narrative voice</soCalled> is the
primary object of the encoding, it may be convenient to identify each
speaker as a <term rend="noindex">participant</term> in the work, and to
associate individual speeches with them by means of the ID/IDREF
mechanism. See section <ptr target="#CCAHPA"/> for discussion of the
<term>participant description</term> component of the TEI Header.
 </p>
<p>For such analyses, it may also be useful to distinguish
representations of speech from representations of thought, in modern
printed texts often indicated by a change of typeface. The
<att>type</att> attribute should be used for this purpose, as in this
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q type="speech">Oh yes,</q><![CDATA[ said Henry, ]]><q type="speech">I mean
Gordon Macrae, for example&#x2026;</q> <q type="thought">Jungian
Analyst with Winebox! That's what you called him, you callous bastard,
didn't you? Eh? Eh?</q></egXML>
<!-- N Williams, The Wimbledon Poisoner, p 204 -->
 </p>
<p>Quoted matter may be embedded within quoted matter, as when one
speaker reports the speech of another:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="Wilson">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day
eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he says:&#x2014;
<q who="Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a
red-headed man.</q></q></egXML>
<!-- A C Doyle, Red headed league (but where?) -->
 </p>
<p>Direct speech nested in this way is treated in the same way as
elsewhere:  a change of rendition may occur, but the same
element should be used. An encoder may however choose to distinguish
between direct speech which contains quotations from extra-textual
matter and direct speech itself, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,</q> the lama half
  sobbed; and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist
  invocation:-<q>
    <quote>
      <l>To Him the Way &#x2014; the Law &#x2014; Apart &#x2014;</l>
      <l>Whom Maya held beneath her heart</l>
      <l>Ananda's Lord &#x2014; the Bodhisat</l>
    </quote>
  And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My
  pilgrimage is well begun. And what work! What work!</q>
</p></egXML> 
<!-- R.Kipling, Kim, Macmillan, 1917(1901) p9 -->
 </p>
<p>Quotations from other works are often accompanied by a reference to
their source. The <gi>cit</gi> element may be used to group together
the quotation and its associated bibliographic reference, which should
be encoded using the elements for bibliographic references discussed in
section <ptr target="#COBI"/>, as in the following example.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="mm01" type="chapter">
<head>Chapter 1</head>
<epigraph><cit>
   <quote>
      <l>Since I can do no good because a woman</l>
      <l>Reach constantly at something that is near it.</l>
   </quote>
   <bibl>
      <title>The Maid's Tragedy</title>
      <author>Beaumont and Fletcher</author>
   </bibl>
</cit></epigraph>
<p>Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into
relief by poor dress...</p>
</div></egXML>
<!-- G. Eliot, Middlemarch, p 1 -->
	<!-- apostrophe added to "Maid's" as per J. Lav, who says     -->
	<!-- Penguin has it. (msm)                                    -->
Like other bibliographic references, the citation attached to a
quotation may be represented simply by a pointer, as in this example:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Lexicography has shown little sign of being affected by the
work of followers of J.R. Firth, probably best summarized
in his slogan, <cit>
    <quote>You shall know a word by the company it keeps.</quote>
    <ref>(Firth, 1957)</ref>
</cit></egXML>
<!-- Hanks, in Looking Up, ed Sinclair, (1987) p.121 -->
Unlike most of the other elements discussed in this chapter, direct
speech and quotations may frequently contain other high-level elements
such as paragraphs or verse lines, as well as being themselves contained
by such elements.  Three possible solutions exist for this well-known
structural problem:
<list type="bullets">
<item>the quotation is broken into segments, each of which
is entirely contained within a paragraph</item>
<item>the quotation is marked up as part of a concurrent but
independent hierarchy</item>
<item>the quotation boundaries are represented by empty milestone
tags</item></list>
For further discussion, and several examples, see chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.</p><p>Finally, in this section, the element <gi>soCalled</gi> is provided
for all cases in which quotation marks are used to distance the quoted
text from the narrator or speaker. Common examples include the
<soCalled>scare</soCalled> quotes often found in newspaper headlines and
advertising copy, where the effect is to cast doubts on the veracity of
an assertion:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head>PM dodges <soCalled>election threat</soCalled> in interview</head></egXML>
<!-- The Guardian, p2, 26 Oct 1992  --></p><p>The same element should be used to mark a variety of special ironic
usages.  Some further examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">He hated <soCalled>good</soCalled> books.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><soCalled>Croissants</soCalled><![CDATA[ indeed! toast not good enough for you?]]></egXML>
<!-- some "real" examples would be better -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Although Chomsky's
decision that all NL sentences are finite objects was never justified
by arguments from the attested properties of NLs, it did have a

<mentioned>language</mentioned> is necessarily restricted to finite
strings.</egXML>
<!-- Langendoen and Postal, Vastness of NLs, p. 24 note 12.        -->
 </p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section are formally defined as
follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOHQQ" n="Quotation">
&q.odd;
&quote.odd;
&cit.odd;
&mentiond.odd;
&socalled.odd;
</specGrp>
	</p></div3><div3 type="burp" xml:id="COHQU"><head>Terms, Glosses, Equivalents and Descriptions</head>
<p>This section describes a set of textual elements which are
used to provide a gloss, alternate identification or description of
something.</p>
<p>Technical terms are often italicized or emboldened upon first mention
in printed texts; an explanation or gloss is sometimes given in
quotation marks.  Linguistic analyses conventionally cite words in
languages under discussion in italics, providing a gloss immediately
following marked with single quotation marks.  Other texts in which
individual words or phrases are <term rend="noindex">mentioned</term> (for<index><term>mention</term><index><term>vs. use</term></index></index><index><term>use</term><index><term>vs. mention</term></index></index>
example, as examples) rather than <term rend="noindex">used</term> may
mark them either with italics or with quotation marks, and will gloss
them less regularly.<specList>
        <specDesc key="term"/>
	<specDesc key="gloss"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>A <gi>term</gi> may appear with or without a gloss, as may a
<gi>mentioned</gi> element.  Where the <gi>gloss</gi> is present, it may
be linked to the term it is glossing by means of the ID/IDREF
mechanism.  To establish such a link, the encoder should give an
<att>xml:id</att> value to the <gi>term</gi> or <gi>mentioned</gi> element
and provide that id as the value of the <att>href</att> attribute on
the <gi>gloss</gi> element.  The following examples demonstrate this
facility:  for more discussion of this and other kinds of linkage within
TEI documents, see chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.
 </p>
<p>Examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">We may define <term xml:id="TDPv" rend="sc">discoursal point of view</term>
as <gloss target="#TDPv">the relationship, expressed through discourse
structure, between the implied author or some other addresser,
xand the fiction.</gloss></egXML>
<!-- Leech, Style in Fiction, (1981) p272 -->

<!-- Gazdar and Mellish, NLP in Prolog, p. 5   -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">There is thus a striking accentual difference between a verbal

<mentioned xml:id="cw235" xml:lang="grc">lutheis</mentioned> <gloss
target="#cw235">released,</gloss> accented on the last.</egXML>
<!-- Sapir, Language (HBJ paperback), p. 79                        -->
 </p><p>Another set of elements is used to supply different kinds of names
for objects described by the TEI. Examples of this are
documentation of  elements, attributes, classes (and also attribute values where
appropriate), and description of glyphs.
<specList>
<specDesc key="altIdent"/>
<specDesc key="desc"/>
<specDesc key="equiv"/>
</specList>
</p><p>When other elements need to refer to an object,
this will generally be done by supplying its identifier,
the <att>ident</att> attribute. Elements in the
TEI scheme also carry a different unique identifier supplied as the
value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute: this is intended only for
internal use, since it depends on the ID/IDREF mechanism.  Identifiers
must be unique across all the modules to be combined in a given
schema.</p><p>The <gi>gloss</gi> element may be used to
provide  a brief explanation of the object if this is not
self-explanatory. For example, the specification for the element <gi>ab</gi> used to mark
arbitrary blocks of text begins as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="linking" ident="ab">
  <gloss>anonymous block</gloss>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec></egXML>
A <gi>gloss</gi> is often used to expand the meaning of a particular
attribute value, supplied within a <gi>valList</gi> element, as in the
following example (taken from the specification of the
<ident>type</ident> attribute of the <gi>abbr</gi> element):
may also be supplied for an attribute name or an
attribute value as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valList type="open">
<valItem ident="suspension">
<gloss>the abbreviation provides the first letter(s) 
of the word or phrase, omitting the remainder.</gloss>
</valItem>
<valItem ident="contraction">
<gloss>the abbreviation omits some letter(s) in the middle.</gloss>
</valItem>
<valItem ident="brevigraph">
<gloss>the abbreviation comprises a special symbol or mark.</gloss>
</valItem>
<!--...-->
</valList></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>equiv</gi>  element is used to provide equivalencies
between the concept represented by this object and those described
in other schemes or ontologies. The <att>uri</att> attribute is used
to supply a pointer to such externally defined concepts. For example,
to indicate that the TEI <gi>p</gi> element is intended to map
directly onto the Docbook <gi>para</gi> element, the declaration for
the former might begin as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="core" ident="p">
<equiv name="para" uri="http://docbook.org"/>
<gloss>paragraph</gloss>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The following more complex example declares that the user-defined <gi>bo</gi> element is
  conceptually equivalent to the markup construct <tag>hi
  rend='bold'</tag>, and that an external definition of this concept
  is available from the URI indicated:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <elementSpec  ident="hi"  mode="change">
    <attList>
      <attDef ident="rend">
	<valList>
	  <valItem ident="bold">
	    <equiv name="BOLD"/>
	    <desc>bold typography</desc>
	  </valItem>
	</valList>
      </attDef>
    </attList>
</elementSpec></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>altIdent</gi> element is used to provide an alternative name
for an object, for example using a different
natural language. Thus, the following might be used to indicate
that the <gi>abbr</gi> element should be identified using the German
word <foreign>Abk&#xFC;rzung</foreign>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec ident="abbr" mode="change">
    <altIdent xml:lang="de">Abk&#xFC;rzung</altIdent>
<!--...--></elementSpec></egXML>
In the same way, the following specification for the
<ident>graphic</ident> element indicates that the attribute
<ident>url</ident> may also be referred to using the alternate
identifier <ident>href</ident>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec ident="graphic" mode="change">
    <attList>
      <attDef mode="change" ident="url">
	<altIdent>href</altIdent>
      </attDef>
<!-- .... -->
    </attList>
</elementSpec>
</egXML>
</p><p>By default, the <gi>altIdent</gi> of a component is
identical to the value of its <att>ident</att> attribute. </p><p>The contents of the <gi>desc</gi> element provide a brief
characterization of the intended function of the object
being documented, in a form that permits its quotation out of
context, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="core" ident="foreign">
<!--... -->
<desc>identifies a word or phrase as belonging to some language other
than that of the surrounding text. </desc>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec></egXML>
By convention, a <gi>desc</gi> element begins with a verb such as
<mentioned>contains</mentioned>, 
<mentioned>indicates</mentioned>, 
<mentioned>specifies</mentioned>, etc. and contains a single
clause. </p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section have the following formal
definitions:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOHQU" n="Terms, glosses, equivs etc.">
&altident.odd;
&desc.odd;
&equiv.odd;
&gloss.odd;
&term.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="burp" xml:id="COHQHEG"><head>Some Further Examples</head>
<p>As a simple example of the elements discussed here, consider the
following sentence:
<q rend="display">On the one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title> is
associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century
France, the <foreign>romans d'antiquit&#xE9;</foreign>,
the romances of Chr&#xE9;tien de Troyes, and the German
adaptations of these works by Heinrich van Veldeke,
Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q>
A first approximation to the encoding of this sentence might be simply
to record the fact that the phrases printed above in italics are
highlighted, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">On the one hand the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is
associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
the <hi xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">romans d'antiquit&eacute;</hi>,
the romances of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, ...</egXML>
This encoding would however lose the important distinction between
an italicized title and an italicized foreign phrase.  Many other
phrases might also be italicized in the text, and a retrieval
program seeking to identify foreign terms (for example) would not
be able to produce reliable results by simply looking for italicized
words.  Where economic and intellectual constraints permit, therefore,
it would be preferable to encode both the function of the
highlighted phrases and their appearance, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">On the one hand the <title rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</title>
is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
the <foreign rend="italic">romans d'antiquit&eacute;</foreign>, the
romances of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, ...</egXML></p>
<p>In this example, the decision as to which textual features
are distinguished by the highlighting is relatively
uncontroversial.  As a less straightforward example, consider the
use of italic font in the following passage
from Samuel Richardson's <title>Clarissa</title> (1747).
<q rend="display">A pretty common case, I believe; in all
<hi rend="it">vehement</hi> debatings.  She says I am
<hi rend="it">too witty</hi>; Anglic&#xE9;,
<hi rend="it">too pert</hi>; I, that she is
<hi rend="it">too wise</hi>; that is to say, being
likewise put into English, <hi rend="it">not so young as
she has been</hi>:  in short, she is grown so much into
a <hi rend="it">mother</hi>, that she had forgotten
she ever was a <hi rend="it">daughter</hi>. ...</q>
 </p>
<p>Clearly, the word <mentioned>vehement</mentioned> is not italicized for the
same reason as the phrase <mentioned>not so young as she has been</mentioned>;
the former is emphasized, while the latter is proverbial.  It also
provides an ironic gloss for the words <mentioned>too wise</mentioned>, in the
same way as <mentioned>too pert</mentioned> glosses <mentioned>too witty</mentioned>.
The glossed phrases are not however technical terms or cited words, but
quoted phrases, as if Clarissa were putting words into her own and her
mother's mouths.  Finally, the words <mentioned>mother</mentioned> and
<mentioned>daughter</mentioned> are apparently italicized simply to oppose them
in the sentence; certainly they do not fit into any of the categories so
far proposed as reasons for italicizing.  Note also that the word
<mentioned>Anglic&#xE9;</mentioned> is not italicized although it is not
generally considered an English word.
 </p>
<p>The following sample encoding for the above passage attempts to take
into account all the above points:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">A pretty common case, I believe; in all <emph>vehement</emph>

<div2 type="section" xml:id="COED"><head>Simple Editorial Changes</head>
<p>As in editing a printed text, so in encoding a text in electronic
form, it may be necessary to accommodate editorial comment on the text
and to render account of any changes made to the text in preparing it.
The tags described in this section may be used to record such editorial
interventions, whether made by the encoder, by the editor of a printed
edition used as a copy text, by earlier editors, or by the copyists of
manuscripts.</p><p>The tags described here handle most common types of editorial
intervention and stereotyped comment; where less structured commentary
of other types is to be included, it should be marked using the
<gi>note</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#CONO"/>.
Systematic interpretive annotation is also possible using the various
methods described in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>. The examples given
here illustrate only simple cases of editorial intervention; in
particular, they permit economical encoding of a simple set of
alternative readings of a short span of text. To encode multiple views
of large or heterogenous spans of text, the mechanisms described in
chapter <ptr target="#SA"/> should be used. To encode multiple
witnesses of a particular text, a similar mechanism designed
specifically for critical editions is described in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>.</p>
<p>For most of the elements discussed here, some encoders may wish to
indicate both a <term>responsibility</term>, that is, a code
indicating the person or agency responsible for making the editorial
intervention in question, and also am indication of the degree of
<term>certainty</term> which the encoder wishes to associate with the
intervention. Because these requirements are common to many of the
elements discussed in this section, they are provided by an attribute
class, called <ident type="class">tei.intervention</ident>. All  members of this
class carry the following optional attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="tei.intervention"/></specList> 
</p>
<p>Many of the elements discussed here (specifically <gi>sic</gi>, <gi>corr</gi>,
<gi>reg</gi>, <gi>orig</gi>, <gi>unclear</gi>, <gi>add</gi>, and
<gi>del</gi>) can be used in two ways. Their primary purpose is to indicate that the text
encoded as the element's content represents an editorial intervention
(or non-intervention) of a specific kind. However, pairs or other
meaningful groupings of such elements can also be supplied,  wrapped
withing a special purpose  <gi>choice</gi> element,
in order to represent  simultaneously a text in its
<soCalled>original</soCalled> uncorrected and unaltered form, and also
one or more <soCalled>edited</soCalled> forms. Such grouped elements
enable software to switch automatically between one
<soCalled>view</soCalled> of a text and another, so that (for example)
a style-sheet may be set to display either the text in its original
form or with editorial interventions of particular kinds.</p>
<!--<p>The <gi>choice</gi> element indicates that its child elements should
be considered as mutually exclusive or in parallel, depending on the
processing goals. That is, the elements described here are intended to
be used when multiple variations or views of a single piece of source
text (say, the original erroneous version and the corrected version)
are to be recorded. One common, but certainly not the only, processing
model for such an element is that a style-sheet would select one and
only one of the children of <gi>choice</gi> for display, printing, or
other processing.</p>-->
<p>Three categories of editorial intervention are discussed in this
section:
<list type="bullets">
<item>indication or correction of apparent errors</item>
<item>indication or regularization of variant, irregular,
non-standard, or eccentric forms</item>
<item>editorial additions, suppressions, and
omissions</item></list></p>
<p>A more extended treatment of the use of these tags in
transcriptional and editorial work is given in chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>.</p>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COEDCOR"><head>Apparent Errors</head>
<p>When the copy text is manifestly faulty, an encoder or transcriber
may elect simply to correct it without comment. For scholarly
purposes, it will often be more generally useful to record both the
correction and the original state of the text. The elements described
here enable all three approaches, and allows the last to be done is
such a way as make it easy for software to present
either the original or the correction. 
<specList>
  <specDesc key="sic"/>
  <specDesc key="corr"/>
  <specDesc key="choice"/>
</specList>
 </p><p>The following examples show alternative treatment of the same
material. The copy text reads:
<q rend="display">Another property of computer-assisted historical
research is that data modelling must permit any one textual feature or
part of a textual feature to be a part of more than one information
model and to allow the researcher to draw on several such models
simultaneously, for example, to select from a machine-readable text
those marginal comments which indicate that the date's mentioned in the
main body of the text are incorrect.</q></p>
<p>An encoder may choose to correct the typographic error, either
silently or with an indication that a correction has been made, as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the <corr>dates</corr><![CDATA[
mentioned in the main body of the text are incorrect.]]></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, the encoder may simply record the typographic
error without correcting it, either without comment or with a
<gi>sic</gi> element to indicate the error is not a transcription error
in the encoding:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the <sic>date's</sic><![CDATA[
mentioned in the main body of the text are incorrect.]]></egXML></p><p>If the encoder elects both to record the original source text
and to provide a correction for the sake of word-search
and other programs, both <gi>sic</gi> and <gi>corr</gi> are used,
wrapped in a <gi>choice</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the
  <choice>
    <corr resp="#msm">dates</corr>
    <sic>date's</sic>
  </choice><![CDATA[ mentioned in the main body of the text are
  incorrect.]]></egXML>The <gi>sic</gi> and <gi>corr</gi> elements can
  appear in either order.</p><p>Note in this example the use of the <att>resp</att>
  attribute, inherited from <ident type="class">tei.intervention</ident>
  class, to indicate the person responsible for correction. The same
  class makes available a  <att>cert</att> attribute,which may be used
  to indicate the degree of editorial
confidence in a particular correction, as in the following example:
<!-- For example, using a
confidence scale of one to ten, an editor may indicate the
conjectural status of a correction by assigning a value to this
attribute of less than ten. In the following instance, some
uncertainty is expressed concerning a commonly-accepted emendation:-->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">An <choice><corr cert="high">Autumn</corr><sic>Antony</sic></choice><![CDATA[ it was,
That grew the more by reaping]]></egXML>
<!-- Antony and Cleopatra, Act 5, scene 2 -->
See further the discussion in section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>.</p>
<p>Where the correction takes the form of adding text, the encoder
must choose whether to use the <gi>corr</gi> (or <gi>sic</gi>) tag,
the <gi>add</gi> tag (see section <ptr target="#COEDADD"/> below), or
the more detailed facilities provided by the additional tag set for
primary source description (see chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>. The
following discussion may be helpful when making this decision:
<list type="simple">
<item>where the correction is an addition by a scribe or author
in a manuscript or other primary source (typescript, proof or galley,
etc.) then either <gi>corr</gi> (or <gi>sic</gi>) or <gi>add</gi> might be
appropriate, depending on the circumstances. The <gi>add</gi> tag is
more expressive, and may convey information on just how the addition
was performed (hand, place, etc.) which the <gi>corr</gi> tag cannot.
See further the discussion in section <ptr target="#PHSU"/>.</item>
<item>where the correction is an addition by a transcriber or editor,
correcting a perceived deficiency in the text but in circumstances where
there is no clearly assertable reason for the deficiency (as a
manuscript lacuna, or damage to the page) the <gi>corr</gi> tag should
be used.  The <gi>add</gi> tag should not be used in this case.</item>
<item>where the correction is an addition by a transcriber or editor,
correcting a perceived deficiency in the text and where there is a
clearly assertable reason for the deficiency (as a manuscript lacuna, or
damage to the page) which the encoder wishes to record, or when
supplying text from a parallel version of the text, the
<gi>supplied</gi> element provided by the additional tag set for primary
source description should be used (see section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>).</item>
</list></p><p>The formal definition of these elements is as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOEDC" n="Editorial tags for correction">
&sic.odd;
&corr.odd;
&choice.odd;
</specGrp>
</p></div3><div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COEDREG"><head>Regularization and Normalization</head>
<p>When the source text makes extensive use of variant forms or
non-standard spellings, it may be desirable for a number of reasons to
<term rend="noindex">regularize</term> it: that is, to provide<index><term>regularization</term></index>
<soCalled>standard</soCalled> or <soCalled>regularized</soCalled> forms
equivalent to the non-standard forms.<note place="foot">In some contexts, the term
<mentioned>regularization</mentioned> has a narrower and more specific
significance than that proposed here: the <gi>reg</gi> element may be
used for any kind of regularization, including normalization,
standardization, and modernization.</note></p><p>As with other such changes to the copy text, the changes may be made
silently (in which case the TEI header should specify the types of
silent changes made) or may be explicitly marked using the following
elements:
<specList>
  <specDesc key="reg"/>
  <specDesc key="orig"/>
  <specDesc key="choice"/>
</specList></p><p>Typical applications for these elements include the production of
editions intended for student or lay readers, linguistic research in
which spelling or usage variation is not the main question at issue,
production of spelling dictionaries, etc.</p><p>Consider this 16th-century text:
<q rend="display">how godly a dede it is to overthrowe so wicked a race
the world may judge: for my part I thinke there canot
be a greater sacryfice to God.</q></p><p>An encoder may choose to preserve the original spelling of this
text, but simply flag it as nonstandard by using the <gi>orig</gi>
element with no attributes specified, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>...how godly a <orig>dede</orig> it is to
<orig>overthrowe</orig> so wicked a race the
world may judge: for my part I <orig>thinke</orig>
there <orig>canot</orig> be a greater
<orig>sacryfice</orig> to God</p></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, the encoder may simply indicate that certain words
have been modernized by using the <gi>reg</gi> element with no
attributes specified, as follows:<egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>...how godly a
<reg>deed</reg> it is to <reg>overthrow</reg> so wicked a race the

there <reg>cannot</reg> be a greater
<reg>sacrifice</reg> to God.</p></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, the encoder may elect to record both old and new
spellings, so that (for example) the same electronic text may serve as
the basis of an old- or new-spelling edition:

<p>The following elements are used to indicate when words or phrases
have been omitted from, added to, or marked for deletion from, a text.
Like the other editorial elements, they allow for a wide range of
editorial practices: 
<specList>
  <specDesc key="gap" atts="reason extent"/>
  <specDesc key="unclear" atts="reason"/>
  <specDesc key="add" atts="place hand"/>
  <specDesc key="del" atts="type status hand"/>
  <specDesc key="choice"/>
</specList></p><p>Encoders may choose to omit parts of the copy text for reasons
ranging from illegibility of the source or impossibility of transcribing
it, to editorial policy, e.g. a systematic exclusion of poetry or prose
from an encoding. The full details of the policy decisions concerned
should be documented in the TEI Header (see section <ptr target="#HD5"/>).
Each place in the text at which omission has taken place should be
marked with a <gi>gap</gi> element, with optionally further information
about the reason for the omission, its extent, and the person or agency
responsible for it, as in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><gap

</p> 
<p>The <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements may be used to record
where words or phrases have been added or deleted in the copy text.
They are not appropriate where longer passages have been added or
deleted, which span several elements; for these, the elements
<gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi>, or other mechanisms described in
chapter <ptr target="#PH"/> must be used.</p>
<p>Additions to a text may be recorded for a number of reasons.
Sometimes they are marked in a distinctive way in the source text, for
example by brackets or insertion above the line (<term rend="noindex">supralinear</term> insertion),<index><term>additions</term><index><term>supralinear</term></index></index><index><term>insertions</term><index><term>supralinear</term></index></index><index><term>supralinear insertions</term></index> as in

these facts</add><![CDATA[ from which this tale takes its title.]]></egXML>
<!-- Mrs Gaskell, The Grey Woman, MS --></p><p>The <gi>add</gi> element should not be used to mark editorial
changes, such as supplying a word omitted by mistake from the source
text or a passage present in another version. In these cases, either
the <gi>corr</gi> or <gi>supplied</gi> tags should be used, as
discussed above in section <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/>, and in section
<ptr target="#PHCC"/>, respectively.</p><p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element is used to mark passages in the
original which cannot be read with confidence, or about which the
transcriber is uncertain for other reasons, as for example when
transcribing a partially inaudible or illegible source. Its
<att>reason</att> and <att>resp</att> attributes are used, as with the
<gi>gap</gi> element, to indicate the cause of uncertainty and the
person responsible for the conjectured reading.</p><p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald</l>
<l><unclear reason="ink blot" resp="#LB">The</unclear> sea between

or from a spoken text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>... and then <unclear reason="passing truck">marbled queen</unclear>...</p></egXML>
</p>
<p>Where there is doubt about the reading of the material affected,
the <att>cert</att> attribute may be used to indicate a degree of
confidence in the reading provided as the content of
<gi>unclear</gi>.</p>
<p>In cases where the reading of an unclear passage is ambiguous, the
various possible readings can be simultaneously encoded using the
<soCalled>choice</soCalled> mechanism. Simultaneously, the
<att>cert</att> attribute may be used to indicate differing degrees of
confidence about the variant readings.
<!--Need better, preferably believable if not real, example:-->
The following fictitious
example is illustrative, although in this case it is easy to verify
the correct reading from other witnesses.

<p>Where the material affected is entirely illegible or inaudible, the
<gi>gap</gi> element discussed above should be used in preference.</p>
<p>The <gi>del</gi> element is used to mark material which is deleted in
the source but which can still be read with some degree of confidence,
as opposed to material which has been omitted by the encoder or
transcriber either because it is entirely illegible or for some other
reason.  This is of particular importance in transcribing manuscript
material, though deletion is also found in printed texts, sometimes for
humorous purposes:

<note type="cit"> S. Townsend: The growing pains of Adrian Mole (1984)

</p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish different
methods of deletion in manuscript or typescript material, as in this
line from the typescript of Eliot's <title>Waste Land</title>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l><del type="overtyped">Mein</del> Frisch
<del type="overstrike">schwebt</del> weht der Wind</l></egXML></p>
<p>Deletion in manuscript or typescript is often associated with
addition:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l><del type="overstrike">Inviolable</del>
   <add place="infralinear">Inexplicable</add>
splendour of Corinthian white and gold</l></egXML>

<!-- the preceding example had del and add wrapped in a choice: that's
definite nonsense, but it;s not clear what the combining element
should be LB 14 dec 04 -->
 </p>
<p>The <gi>del</gi> element should not be used where the deletion is
such that material cannot be read with confidence, or read at all, or
where the material has been omitted by the transcriber or editor for
some other reason. Where the material cannot be read with confidence
following deletion, the <gi>unclear</gi> tag should be used with the
<att>reason</att> attribute indicating that the difficulty of
transcription is due to deletion. Where material has been omitted by
the transcriber or editor, this may be indicated by use of the
<gi>corr</gi> (or <gi>sic</gi>) and <gi>gap</gi> elements. Observe that
the distinction between recommended uses of the <gi>del</gi>,
<gi>corr</gi>, and <gi>gap</gi> tags parallels the distinction drawn
between the <gi>add</gi>, <gi>corr</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi> tags in
section <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/> and section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>:
<list type="simple">

appropriate, depending on the circumstances. The <gi>del</gi> tag is

<div2 type="section" xml:id="CONA"><head>Names, Numbers, Dates, Abbreviations, and Addresses</head>
<p>This section describes a number of  textual features which it is
often convenient to distinguish from their surrounding text.  Names,
dates, and numbers are likely to be of particular importance to  the
scholar treating a text as source for a database; distinguishing such
items from the surrounding text is however equally important to the
scholar primarily interested in lexis.</p>
<p>The treatment of these textual features proposed here is not
intended to be exhaustive: fuller treatments for names, numbers,
measures, and dates are provided in the additional tag set for
names and dates (see chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>).</p>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONARS"><head>Referring Strings</head>
<p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some
person, place, object etc. Two elements are provided to mark such
strings:
<specList>
<specDesc key="rs"/>
<specDesc key="name"/>
</specList>
Where it is thought useful to do so, the kind of object referred to may
be specified using the <att>type</att> attribute.
 </p>
<p>Examples include:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs></q><![CDATA[, said his lady to him
one day, ]]><q>have you heard that <rs type="place">Netherfield Park</rs>
is let at last?</q></egXML>
<!-- Austen Pride and Prejudice, chap 1 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Collectors of water-rents were appointed by the
<rs type="organization">Watering Committee</rs><![CDATA[.

<!-- Little Dorrit, peng ed, p 153 -->
</p><p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be used
for any reference to a person, place, etc., not only to references in
the form of a proper noun or noun phrase.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs></q><![CDATA[, said
]]><rs type="person">his lady</rs><![CDATA[ to him one day ...]]></egXML>
</p><p>The <gi>name</gi> element by contrast is provided for the special
case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may
be used synonymously with the <gi>rs</gi> element, or nested within it
if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper nouns.
The following example shows an alternative way of encoding the short
sentence from <title>Pride and Prejudice</title> quoted above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <name type="person">Mr. Bennet</name>,</q><![CDATA[ said 
]]><rs type="person">his lady</rs><![CDATA[ to him one day, ]]><q>have you heard
that <name type="place">Netherfield Park</name> is let at last?</q></egXML>
The following example shows how a proper name may be nested within a
referring string:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rs>His Excellency the Life President, <name>Ngwazi Dr H. Kamuzu Banda</name></rs></egXML>
<!-- any issue of the Malawi Daily Times -->
 </p>
<p>Simply tagging something as a name is generally not enough to enable
automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms usually
required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the text may
be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague.  Moreover, name prefixes
such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>,  may or may not be
included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the
language and country of origin of the bearer.
 </p>
<p>The following attribute, common to all members of the
<ident type="class">tei.names</ident>
element class, is provided to help overcome these difficulties:
<specList><specDesc key="tei.names" atts="key"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>This attribute may be specified, as appropriate.
The <att>key</att> attribute may be useful as a means of gathering
together all references to the same individual or location scattered
throughout a document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs key="BENM1" type="person"> Mr. Bennet</rs>,</q><![CDATA[ said
]]><rs key="BENM2" type="person">his lady</rs><![CDATA[ to him one day, ]]><q>have
you heard that <rs key="NETP1" type="place">Netherfield Park</rs> is
let at last?</q></egXML></p>
<p>This use should be distinguished from the case of a nested 
<att>reg</att> (regularization) element, which provides a
means of marking the standard form of a referencing string as
demonstrated below:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">My personal life during the administration of
<rs key="POJA1" type="person"><reg>Polk, James K.</reg>Col. Polk</rs><![CDATA[

<!-- de Laclos: Les Liaisons dangereuses, 1963, p.13 -->
</p>
<p>The <gi>choice</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#COED"/> may be
more appropriate in cases where the
normalised form of a name is preferable for some purposes to the form
actrually attested in the document being encoded:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p><choice>
<sic><name key="WADLM1" type="person">Walter de la Mare</name></sic>
<reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg>

<name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</p></egXML>
<!-- Frank Swinnerton, The Georgian Literary Scene, 1938, p. 195 -->
</p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#CONOIX"/> may be
more appropriate if the function of the regularization is to provide a
consistent index:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a large parish.
At the time of the events which led to
<name type="person">Fournier</name>'s <index><term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques Fournier)</term></index>
investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250 inhabitants.</p></egXML>
<!-- E.L Ladurie: Montaillou, Penguin 1980, p3 -->
	<!-- but should we quote the French? (LB) -->

 Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have
 two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its
 regularised form must be repeated many times; and the burden of
 additional XML markup in the body of the text may be inconvenient to
 maintain and complex to process. For applications such as onomastics,
 relating to persons or places named rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed
analysis of the component parts of a name is needed, the specialized
elements described in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> or the analytical
tools described in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/> should be used.
 </p>
<p>These elements are formally declared as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCONA" n="Proper Names">
&name.odd;
&rs.odd;
</specGrp>
</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONAAD"><head>Addresses</head>
<p>The simplest way of encoding an address is to regard it as a series
of distinct lines, just as they might be printed on an envelope. The
following elements support this view:
<specList><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="addrLine"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Alternatively, an address may be encoded as a structure composed of
the following elements, which constitute the <ident type="class">tei.addrPart</ident> element class:
<specList><specDesc key="street"/><specDesc key="name" atts="type"/><specDesc key="postCode"/><specDesc key="postBox"/></specList>
Any number of  elements from the <ident type="class">tei.addrPart</ident>
class may appear
within an address and in any order. None of them is required. Where
code letters are commonly used in addresses (for example, to identify
regions or countries) a useful practice is to supply the full name of
the region or country as the content of the element, but to supply the
abbreviatory code as the value of the global <att>n</att> attribute, so
that (for example) an application preparing formatted labels can readily
find the required information. Other components of addresses should be
represented using the general-purpose <gi>name</gi> element.</p><p>Some examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <addrLine>110 Southmoor Road,</addrLine>
   <addrLine>Oxford OX2 6RB,</addrLine>
   <addrLine>UK</addrLine>
</address></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The above address could also be represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <street>110 Southmoor Road</street>
   <name type="city">Oxford</name>
   <postCode>OX2 6RB</postCode>
   <name type="country">United Kingdom</name>
</address></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The order of elements within an address is highly culture-specific,
and is therefore unconstrained:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <name type="org">Universit&#xE0; di Bologna</name>
   <name type="country">Italy</name>
   <postCode>40126</postCode>
   <name type="city">Bologna</name>
   <street>via Marsala 24</street>
</address></egXML>
 </p>
<p>For further discussion of ways of regularizing the names of places,
see section <ptr target="#CONA"/>. A full postal address may also include
the name of the addressee, tagged as above using the general purpose
<gi>name</gi> element. When the additional tag set for names and dates
is enabled, more specific elements such as <gi>publisher</gi> or
<gi>org</gi> may be used, as further discussed in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>.
 </p>
<p>The <gi>address</gi> element and its components are formally
described as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOAD" n="Addresses and their components">
&address.odd;
&addrline.odd;
&street.odd;
&postcode.odd;
&postbox.odd;
<p>Other components of addresses should be represented
using the general purpose NAME element</p>
</specGrp>
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONANU"><head>Numbers and Measures</head><p>This section describes two elements provided for the simple encoding
of numbers and measures and gives some indication of circumstances in
which this may usefully be done.  The following phrase level elements
are provided for this purpose:
<specList><specDesc key="num" atts="type value"/><specDesc key="measure" atts="type"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Like names or abbreviations, numbers can occur virtually anywhere in
a text.  Numbers are special in that they can be written with either
letters or digits (<mentioned>twenty-one</mentioned>, <mentioned>xxi</mentioned>, and
<mentioned>21</mentioned>) and their presentation is language-dependent (e.g.
English <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English
<mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned> equals French <mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>).
 </p>
<p>For many kinds of application, e.g. natural-language processing or
machine translation, numbers are not regarded as
<soCalled>lexical</soCalled> in the same way as other parts of a text.
For these and other applications, the <gi>num</gi> element provides a
convenient method of distinguishing numbers from the surrounding text.
For other kinds of application, numbers are only useful if normalized:
here the <gi>num</gi> element is useful precisely because it provides a
standardized way of representing a numerical value.
 </p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><num value="33">xxxiii</num>
<num type="cardinal" value="21">twenty-one</num>
<num type="percentage" value="10">ten percent</num>
<num type="percentage" value="10">10%</num>
<num type="ordinal" value="5">5th</num></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><num type="fraction" value="0.5">one half</num>
<num type="fraction" value="0.5">1/2</num></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The word <mentioned>measure</mentioned> is used here to refer to a special
kind of referring string, the referent of which is a <soCalled>virtual
object</soCalled>.  In its fullest form, a measure consists of a number,
a phrase expressing units of measure and a phrase expressing the
commodity being measured.  Not all of these components need be present
in every case.  For some applications, particularly quantitative ones,
the internal components of measure need to be marked so that their
values can be calculated.  Thus, in order to evaluate a monetary measure
according to some standard, it is necessary to mark its currency unit
(e.g.  US dollars, pounds sterling).  Similarly, the expression <mentioned>2
ounces</mentioned> will have a different meaning when it is associated with
<mentioned>flour</mentioned> from that which it has when associated with
<mentioned>water</mentioned>.
 </p>
<p>Such applications will require the elements discussed in chapter
<ptr target="#ND"/>, or the more powerful analytical tools discussed in
chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>.  Elsewhere, it may be sufficient simply to
encode measures as such, perhaps also indicating their numeric content
with the <gi>num</gi> element, as in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>I've measured it from side to side</l>
<l>'Tis
<measure type="length">    
<num value="3">three</num> feet</measure>
long, and
<measure type="length">   
<num value="2">two</num> feet</measure>
wide.</l></egXML>
<!-- Wordsworth: The Thorn: Lyrical Ballads (1798) -->
As the above example also demonstrates, the <gi>measure</gi> element is
a member of the class <ident type="class">tei.names</ident> like other
referencing strings, and may thus bear a <att>reg</att> attribute to
indicate a normalized value.  The form of normalization used should
conform to a defined standard such as the International System of
Units (SI).  The <gi>measure</gi> element may also carry a <att>key</att>
attribute to indicate a database key value, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list>
  <item><measure key="BH2" type="volume">         
        <num value="2">ii</num> bags hops
        </measure>
  </item>
  <item><measure key="TW6" type="volume">         
        <num value="6">six</num> trusses Woolen and linen goods
        </measure>
  </item>
  <item><measure key="WC5" type="weight">
        5 tonnes coale
       </measure>
  </item>
</list></egXML>
<!-- Gloucester Port Books -->
 </p>
<p>These elements are formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCONU" n="Numbers and measures">
&num.odd;
&measure.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONADA"><head>Dates and Times</head>
<p>Dates and times, like numbers, can appear in widely varying
culture- and language-dependent forms, and can pose similar problems
in automatic language processing.  The following elements are provided
to identify them:
 <specList>
<specDesc key="date" atts="calendar value"/><specDesc key="time" atts="value"/><specDesc key="dateRange" atts="calendar from to exact"/><specDesc key="timeRange" atts="from to exact"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Dates can occur virtually anywhere in a text, but in some contexts
(e.g. bibliographic citations) their encoding is recommended or
required rather than optional.  Times can also appear anywhere but
are generally optional.
 </p>
<p>Partial dates or times (e.g. <mentioned>1990</mentioned>, <mentioned>September
1990</mentioned>, <mentioned>twelvish</mentioned>) can be expressed in the
<att>value</att> attribute by simply omitting a part of the value
supplied.  Imprecise dates or times (for example <mentioned>early
August</mentioned>, <mentioned>some time after ten and before twelve</mentioned>)
may be expressed as date or time ranges.  If either end of the date or
time range is known to be accurate (for example, <mentioned>at some time
before 1230</mentioned>, <mentioned>a few days after Hallowe'en</mentioned>), the
<att>exact</att> attribute may be used to specify this.
 </p>
<p>Where the certainty (i.e. reliability) of the date or time itself is
in question, rather than its precision, the encoder should record this
fact using the mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>.
 </p>
<p>These mechanisms are useful primarily for fully specified dates or
times known with certainty.  If component parts of dates or times are to
be marked up, or if a more complex analysis of the meaning of a temporal
expression is required, the techniques described in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> should be used in preference to the simple method
 outlined here.
 </p>
<p>The <att>value</att> attribute is a useful way of normalizing or
 disambiguating  dates and times which can appear in many formats, as
 the following examples show: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date value="1980-02-12">12/2/1980</date></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Given on the <date value="1977-06-12">Twelfth Day of June
in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and
Seventy-seven of the Republic the Two Hundredth and first
and of the University the Eighty-Sixth.</date></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <ident>value</ident> attribute always supplies a normalized
representation of the date given as content of the <gi>date</gi>
element. The format used should be one of those standardized in ISO
8601:2000, and also a valid W3C schema datatype. Some typical examples
follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date value="2001">The
year 2001</date>
<date value="2001-09">September 2001</date>
<date value="2001-09-11">11 Sept 01</date>
<date value="--09-11">9/11</date>
<date value="--09">September</date>
<date value="---11">Eleventh of the month</date>
<time value="08:48:00">8:48</time>
<date value="2001-09-11T12:48:00">Sept 11th, 12 minutes before 9 am</date>
</egXML>Note in the last example the use of a normalized representation for
the date string which includes a time: this example could thus equally
well be tagged using the <gi>time</gi> element. 
</p>
<p>The following examples demonstrate the use of the
<gi>dateRange</gi> element to mark a period of time:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Those five years — 
<dateRange from="1918" to="1923">1918 to 1923</dateRange>
— had been, he suspected,
somehow very important.</p></egXML>

<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONAAB"><head>Abbreviations and Their Expansions</head>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to mark abbreviations in the copy text,
whether to trigger special processing for them, to provide the full form
of the word or phrase abbreviated, or to allow for different possible
expansions of the abbreviation. Abbreviations may be transcribed as
they stand, or expanded; they may be left unmarked, or marked using
these tags: 
<specList>
<specDesc key="abbr" />
<specDesc key="expan"/>
<specDesc key="choice" />
</specList>
</p><p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing
semi-lexical items such as acronyms or jargon:

the ]]><abbr>CTI</abbr><![CDATA[ Centre for Textual Studies.]]></egXML>
 </p><p>The <gi>expan</gi> element may be combined with the <gi>abbr</gi>
element inside a <gi>choice</gi> element to provide an expansion of the
abbreviation.<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>RELAXNG</abbr><expan>regular

element to indicate whether the abbreviated or expanded version was
that which was present in the copy text.</p>
<p>These elements are particularly useful where manuscript materials
in which abbreviation is very frequent are being transcribed. For
example:

</p><p>Here an entity reference <ident type="ge">per</ident> has been used to
represent the common manuscript symbol <mentioned>crossed-p</mentioned>, and its
expansion supplied in the associated <gi>expan</gi> element.</p><p>In practice, it may be most convenient to transcribe the abbreviation
as an entity reference; this allows the entity reference itself to be
expanded either as an <gi>abbr</gi> or as an <gi>expan</gi> element,
depending on the processing to be done at the moment.

<div2 type="section" xml:id="COXR"><head>Simple Links and Cross References</head>
<p>Cross-references or links between one location in a document and one or more
other locations, either in the same or different XML documents, may be encoded
using the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi>, as discussed in this
section. These elements both <soCalled>point</soCalled> from one
location in a document, the place that the element itself appears, to
another (or to several), specified by the <att>href</att> attribute.
Linkages of several other kinds are also provided for in these
guidelines; see further chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.
 </p>
<p>The pointing system employed by these elements is the W3C XPointer
mechanism. Thus the value of the <att>href</att> attribute may be as
simple as a reference to the global <att>xml:id</att> attribute that
appears on the target element that is in the same document as the <gi>ptr</gi>
or <gi>ref</gi>, or as complicated as a full URI with embedded
XPointers. For example, the source of the following paragraph looks
something like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>For an introductionto using XPointers, 
see <ptr target="#SG-id"/>; for the complete XPointer specification, see
<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/"/>,

for a discussion of TEI schemes for XPointer, see below.</p></egXML>
 Alternatively, if no explicit link is
to be encoded, but it is simply required to mark the phrase as a
cross-reference, the <gi>ref</gi> element may be used without a
<att>href</att> attribute.</p>
<p>For an introduction to using XPointers, see <?tei winita: replace
this PI with a <ptr/> ?>; for the complete XPointer specification, see
<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/"/>, <ptr

<p>
<specList><specDesc key="ptr" /><specDesc key="ref" /></specList>
 </p>
<p>The elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> share, as members of the
element class <ident type="class">tei.pointer</ident>, the following
attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="tei.pointer" /></specList>
 </p>
<p>The shared attributes of the two elements may be used in the same
way; the difference between the elements is that while the <gi>ptr</gi>
element is empty, the <gi>ref</gi> element may contain phrases
specifying, or defining more exactly, the target of a cross reference,
which form the content of the element. Since its content thus serves as
a human-readable pointer, in the simplest case a <gi>ref</gi> element
need not identify its target in any other way. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See <ref>section 12 on page 34</ref><![CDATA[.]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>More usually, it will be desirable to identify the target of the
cross-reference using the <att>href</att> attribute, so that
processing software can access it directly, for example to implement a
linkage or to generate an appropriate reference. Assuming that section
12 in the previous example has been tagged <tag>div1 xml:id="SEC12"</tag>, the
same cross reference might more exactly be encoded as
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on page 34</ref><![CDATA[.]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>If the text for the cross reference is to be generated according to a
fixed pattern, or if no text is to appear in the body of the cross
reference, the <gi>ptr</gi> element would be used as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See in particular <ptr target="#SEC12"/><![CDATA[.]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>A cross-reference may point to any number of locations simultaneously,
simply by giving more than one identifier as the value of its
<att>href</att> attribute.  This may be particularly useful where
an analytic index is to be encoded, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list>
   <item>Saints aid rejected in mel. <ptr target="#p299"/></item>
   <item>Sallets censured <ptr target="#p143 #p144"/></item>
   <item>Sanguine mel. signs <ptr target="#p263 #p312 #p332"/></item>
   <item>Scilla or sea onyon, a purger of mel. <ptr target="#p442"/></item>
</list></egXML>

	<!-- 1846, p743                                               -->
Here the targets of the cross references are simply page numbers; it is
assumed that corresponding elements with identifiers <ident>p299</ident> <ident>p143</ident>, etc. have been provided
in the body of the text.</p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used, as
elsewhere, to categorize the cross reference according to any system of
importance to the encoder. If bibliographic references
require special processing (e.g. in order to provide a consistent
short-form reference), they might be tagged thus:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Similar forms, often called <term rend="ldquo rdquo">rewriting

	<!-- Ellis Horwood, 1990), p. 24.                             -->
Here <code>type="bibliog"</code> signals for the processing
appropriate to a bibliographic reference, which implies that the possible
targets of the pointer are bibliographic
elements, and <code>target="#Chom59"</code> indicates which
bibliographic element is actually being referred to. For further
discussion of bibliographic references, see section <ptr target="#COBIXR"/>.
 </p><p>The <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> tags have many applications in
addition to the simple cross-referencing facilities illustrated in this
section. In conjunction with the analytic tools discussed
in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/>, <ptr target="#AI"/>, and <ptr target="#FS"/>, they may be
used to link analyses of a text to their object, to combine
corresponding segments of a text, or to align segments of a text with a
temporal or other axis or with each other.</p><p>These elements are formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOXR" n="Simple cross references">
&ptr.odd;
&ref.odd;
</specGrp>
</p> 
</div2>
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COLI"><head>Lists</head>
<p>The following elements are provided for the encoding of lists,
their constituent items, and the labels or headings associated
with them:
<specList><specDesc key="list" /><specDesc key="item"/><specDesc key="label"/><specDesc key="head"/><specDesc key="headLabel"/><specDesc key="headItem"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>list</gi> element should be used to mark any kind of
<term rend="noindex">list</term>:
numbered, lettered, bulleted, or unmarked.  Lists formatted as such in
the copy text should in general be encoded using this element, with an
appropriate value for the <att>type</att> attribute.  Lists given as
run-on text may also be encoded using this element, where this is felt
to be appropriate.
 </p>
<p>Each distinct item in the list should be encoded as a distinct
<gi>item</gi> element.  If the numbering or other identification for the
items in a list is unremarkable and may be reconstructed by any
processing program, no enumerator need be specified.  If however an
enumerator is retained in the encoded text, it may be supplied either by
using the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>item</gi> element, or by
using a <gi>label</gi> element.  The following examples are thus
equivalent:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I will add two facts, which have seldom occurred in
the composition of six, or at least of five quartos.
<list rend="runon" type="ordered">
      <label>(1)</label>
      <item>My first rough manuscript, without any
intermediate copy, has been sent to the press.</item>
      <label>(2)</label>
      <item>Not a sheet has been seen by any human
eyes, excepting those of the author and the printer:
the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.</item>
   </list></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I will add two facts, which have seldom occurred in
the composition of six, or at least of five quartos.
<list rend="runon" type="ordered">
      <item n="1">My first rough manuscript, without any
intermediate copy, has been sent to the press.</item>
      <item n="2">Not a sheet has been seen by any human
eyes, excepting those of the author and the printer:
the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.</item>
   </list></egXML>
The two styles may not be mixed in the same list:  if one item is
preceded by a label, all must be.
 </p>
<p>A list need not necessarily be displayed in list format.  For
example, the following is a reasonable encoding of a list which (in
the original) is simply printed as a single paragraph:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">On those remote pages it is written that animals are
divided into <list>
   <item n="a">those that belong to the Emperor, </item>
   <item n="b">embalmed ones, </item>
   <item n="c">those that are trained, </item>
   <item n="d">suckling pigs, </item>
   <item n="e">mermaids,  </item>
   <item n="f">fabulous ones, </item>
   <item n="g">stray dogs, </item>
   <item n="h">those that are included in this classification, </item>
   <item n="i">those that tremble as if they were mad, </item>

   <item n="k">those drawn with a very fine camel's-hair brush, </item>
   <item n="l">others, </item>
   <item n="m">those that have just broken a flower vase, </item>
   <item n="n">those that resemble flies from a distance. </item>
   </list></egXML>

 </p>
<p>A list may be given a heading or title, for which the <gi>head</gi>
element should be used, as in the next example, which also demonstrates
simple use of the <gi>label</gi> element to mark a tabular or glossary
list in which each item is associated with a word or phrase rather than
a numeric or alphabetic enumerator:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss">
 <head>Report of the conduct and progress of Ernest Pontifex.
   Upper Vth form &#x2014; half term ending Midsummer 1851</head>
 <label>Classics</label>    <item>Idle listless and unimproving</item>
 <label>Mathematics</label> <item>ditto</item>
 <label>Divinity</label>    <item>ditto</item>
 <label>Conduct in house</label> <item>Orderly</item>
 <label>General conduct</label>
 <item>Not satisfactory, on account of his great 
    unpunctuality and inattention to duties</item>
</list></egXML>
<!-- S Butler, Way of all Flesh, -->
 </p>
<p>In such a list, the individual items have internal structure.  In
complex cases, where list items contain many components, the list is
better treated as a <term rend="noindex">table</term>,
<index><term>tables</term><index><term>and
lists</term></index></index> on which see chapter <ptr target="#FT" type="div1"/>.  A particularly important instance of the simple two-column
table is the <soCalled>glossary list</soCalled>, which should be marked
by the tag <tag>list type="gloss"</tag>.  In such lists, each
<gi>label</gi> element contains a term and each <gi>item</gi> its gloss;
it is a semantic error for a list tagged with <code>type="gloss"</code> not to have labels.  For example:
<!-- Moreland and Fleischer, Latin:  An Intensive Course, 53. -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss">
  <head>Unit Three &#x2014; Vocabulary</head>
  <label xml:lang="la">acerbus, -a, -um     </label> <item>bitter, harsh</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">ager, agr&#x12B;, M. </label> <item>field</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">audi&#x14D;, &#x12B;re,
    &#x12B;v&#x12B;, &#x12B;tus         </label> <item>hear, listen (to)</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">bellum, -&#x12B;, N. </label> <item>war</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">bonus, -a, -um       </label> <item>good</item>
</list></egXML>
Additionally, the  <gi>term</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi> elements discussed
in section <ptr target="#COHQU"/> might be used to make explicit the role
that each column in the glossary list has, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss">
  <head>Unit Three &#x2014; Vocabulary</head>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">acerbus, -a, -um</term> </label>
  <item><gloss>bitter, harsh</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">ager, agr&#x12B;, M. </term> </label>
  <item><gloss>field</gloss> </item>
  <label>
	<term xml:lang="la">audi&#x14D;, -&#x12B;re, -&#x12B;v&#x12B;, -&#x12B;tus</term>
  </label>
  <item><gloss>hear, listen (to)</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">bellum, -&#x12B;, N. </term> </label>
  <item><gloss>war</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">bonus, -a, -um</term> </label>
  <item><gloss>good</gloss> </item>
</list></egXML>
Note in the above examples the use of the global <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute to specify on the <gi>label</gi> (or <gi>term</gi>) element
what language the term is from.  For further discussion of the
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute see section <ptr target="#STGA" type="div2"/>, and
section <ptr target="#CHSH" type="div2"/>.  A more elaborate markup for this
glossary would distinguish the headword forms from the grammatical
information (principal parts and gender), using tags described more
fully in chapters <ptr target="#TE" type="div1"/> or <ptr target="#DI" type="div1"/>.
 </p>
<p>In addition to the <gi>head</gi> element used to supply
a title or heading for the whole list, headings for the two
columns of a glossary-style list may be specified using
the two special elements <gi>headLabel</gi> and <gi>headItem</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The simple, straightforward statement of an idea is
preferable to the use of a worn-out expression.
<list type="gloss">
  <headLabel>TRITE</headLabel>
  <headItem>SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD</headItem>

</list></egXML>
<!-- Warriner's English Composition p. 280                    -->
 </p>
<p>The elements <gi>label</gi>, <gi>head</gi>, <gi>headLabel</gi>, and
<gi>headItem</gi> may contain only phrase-level elements.  The
<gi>item</gi> element however may contain paragraphs or other
<soCalled>chunks</soCalled>, including other lists.  In this example, a
glossary list contains two items, each of which is itself a simple list:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss">
   <label>EVIL</label>
   <item>
      <list type="simple">

            of all hope of recovery.</item>

            all the world to be miserable.</item>
         <item>I am divided from mankind &#x2014; a solitaire; one
            banished from human society.</item>
      </list> 
   </item>

   <item>
      <list type="simple">
         <item>But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my

         <item>But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's
            crew, to be spared from death...</item>
         <item>But I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place,

<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONONO"><head>Notes and Simple Annotation</head>
<p>The following elements are provided for the encoding of
discursive notes, either already present in the copy text or
supplied by the encoder:
<specList><specDesc key="note" /></specList>	
 </p>
<p>A <term rend="noindex">note</term><index><term>notes</term></index>
is any additional comment found in a text, marked in some way as being
out of the main textual stream.  All notes should be marked using the
same tag, <gi>note</gi>, whether they appear as block notes in the main
text area, at the foot of the page, at the end of the chapter or volume,
in the margin, or in some other place.
 </p>
<p>Notes may be in a different hand or typeface, may be authorial or
editorial, and may have been added later.  Attributes may be used to
specify these and other characteristics of notes, as detailed below.
 </p>
<p>Where possible, the body of a note should be inserted in the text at
the point at which its identifier or mark first appears.  This may not
be possible for example with marginal notes, which may not be anchored
to an exact location.  For simplicity, it may be adequate to position
marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other element.  In some
cases, however, it may be desirable to transcribe notes not at their
point of attachment to the text but at their point of appearance (at the
end of the volume, or the end of the chapter &#x2014; not, in general, when
the notes appear at the foot of the page); in this case the
<att>target</att> and <att>targetEnd</att> attributes should be used to
specify the point of attachment.  In some cases, the note is explicitly
attached not to a point but to a span of text; for a full discussion of
pointing to points and spans in the text, see section <ptr target="#COXR" type="div1"/>.

 </p>
<p>In addition to transcribing notes from the copy text, researchers may
wish to annotate the electronic text itself, by attaching analytic notes
in some structured vocabulary to particular passages of text, e.g. to
specify the topics or themes of a text.  The empty <gi>span</gi> element
is provided for such applications; it is available only when the
additional tag set for simple analysis is selected (see section <ptr target="#AISP"/>).
 </p>
<p>The formal declarations for the <gi>note</gi> element is this:

 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CONOIX"><head>Index Entries</head>
<p>The indexing of scholarly texts is a skilled activity, involving
substantial amounts of human judgment and analysis. It should not therefore be
assumed that simple searching and information retrieval software will
be able to meet all the needs addressed by a well-crafted manual
index, although it may complement them for example by providing free
text search. The role of an index is to provide access via
keywords and phrases which are not necessarily present in the text
itself, but must be added by the skill of the indexer. 
</p>
<div4><head>Pre-existing indexes</head>
<p>When encoding a pre-existing text, therefore, if such an index
is present it may be advisable to retain it along with the text,
rather than attempt to generate it automatically. Elements discussed
elsewhere in these Guidelines may be used for this purpose. For
example, the <gi>div1</gi> element or <gi>div</gi> element may be used
to mark the section of the text containing the index and the
<gi>list</gi> element might be used to mark the index itself, each
entry being represented by an <gi>item</gi> element, possibly
containing within it a series of <gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi>
elements, as follows:
<egXML  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="index">
<!--...-->
<list type="index">
<item>Women, how cause of mel. <ref>193</ref>; their vanity in
apparell taxed, <ref>527</ref>; their counterfeit tears
<ref>547</ref>; their vices <ref>601</ref>, commended,
<ref>624</ref>.</item>
<item>Wormwood, good against mel. <ref>443</ref></item>
<item>World taxed, <ref>181</ref></item>
<item>Writers of the cure of mel. 295</item>
<!--...-->
</list>
</div></egXML>
</p>
<p>Note that this simple representation does not capture the nested
structure of the first of these index entries. A more accurate representation might
entail the use of nested lists like the following:
<egXML  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><item>Women, 
   <list><item>how cause of mel. <ref>193</ref>;</item> 
      <item>their vanity in apparell taxed, <ref>527</ref>;</item>
      <item>their counterfeit tears <ref>547</ref>;</item>
      <item>their vices 
          <list><item><ref>601</ref>,</item>
              <item> commended, <ref>624</ref>.</item>
           </list></item>
   </list>
</item></egXML>
</p>
<p>The page references, encoded simply as <gi>ref</gi> elements above,
might also include direct links to the appropriate location in the
encoded text, using (for example) a target attribute to supply the
identifier of an associated page break element:
<egXML  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><!-- in the text -->
<pb xml:id="P624"/> <!-- start of  page 624 -->
<!-- in the index -->
<ref target="#P624">624</ref>
</egXML>
For further discussion of this and alternative ways of encoding such
links see the discussion in section <ptr target="#SA"/>. Note that
similar methods may also be used to encode a table of contents, as
further exemplified in section <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/>.
</p>
</div4>
<div4><head>Auto-generated indexes</head>
<p>It can also be useful, however, to generate a new index from a
machine-readable text, whether the text is being written for the first time
with the tags here defined, or as an addition to a text transcribed from
some other source. Depending on the complexity of the text and its subject
matter, such an automatically-generated index may not in itself satisfy all
the needs of scholarly users. However it can assist a professional indexer
to construct a fully adequate index, which might then be post-edited into
the digital text, marked-up along the lines already suggested for preserving
pre-existing index material.</p>
<p>Indexes generally contain both  references to specific pages or
sections and references to page ranges or sequences. The same element
is used in either case:
<specList>
<specDesc key="index" />
</specList>
</p>
<p>Like the <gi>interp</gi> element described in <ptr target="#AISP"/>
this element may be used simply to provide descriptive or interpretive
label of some kind for any location within a text, to be processed in
any way by analytic software, but their main purpose is to facilitate
the generation of an index for a printed version of the text. The
headwords to be used when making up this index are given by the
<gi>term</gi> elements within the <gi>index</gi>
element, while the location of the generated index
may be specified by the <gi>divGen</gi> element.
<specList><specDesc key="term" />
<specDesc key="divGen" /></specList>
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, a single headword is supplied  by
an  <gi>term</gi> elements contained by an
<gi>index</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The students understand procedures for Arabic lemmatisation
<index>
  <term>Lemmatization, Arabic</term>
</index>and are beginning to build parsers.</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The effect of this will be to generate an index entry for the term
<q>Lemmatization</q>,
referencing the location of the original <gi>index</gi> element. </p>
<p>If the subject of Arabic lemmatization is treated at length
in a text, then the index entry generated may need to reference a
sequence of locations (e.g. page numbers). In such a case it will be necessary to identify the end of the relevant
span of text as well as its starting point. This is most conveniently
done by supplying an  empty <gi>anchor</gi> element (as discussed in chapter
<ptr target="#SA"/>) at the appropriate point and pointing to it from
the <gi>index</gi> element by means of its <ident>spanTo</ident>
attribute, as
in this example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>We now turn to the
topic of Arabic lemmatisation
<index spanTo="#ALEMEND">
  <term>Lemmatization, Arabic</term>
</index> concerning which it is important to note .....
<!-- much learned material ommitted here -->
and now we can  build our parser.<anchor xml:id="ALAMEND"/></p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>This would generate the same index entries as the previous example,
but the reference would be to the whole span of text between the
location of the <gi>index</gi> element and the location of the element
identified by the code <ident>ALAMEND</ident>, rather than
a single point, and thus might (for
example) include a sequence of page numbers.</p>
<p>Although the position of the <gi>index</gi> element in the text
provides the target location that will be specified in the generated index
entry, no part of the text itself is used to construct that entry. Index
terms appearing in the entry come solely from the content of <gi>term</gi>
elements, which consequently may have to repeat words or phrases from the
text proper. This need not be done verbatim, thus giving scope for
normalization of spelling (as in the example above) or other modifications which may assist
generation of an index in a desired form or sequence.</p>
<!-- sorting -->
<p>Sometimes, for example when
index terms are taken from a different language or consist of
mathematical formulae or other expressions, even a
normalized form of an index term may be insufficent for an application to
order it exactly as desired. The <att>sortKey</att> attribute may be
used to address this problem, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The @ operator 
<index><term sortKey="0000">@</term></index> precedes an
attribute name</p></egXML> Here, an entry for the symbol @ will appear
in the index, but will be sorted alphabetically as if it were the
string <val>0000</val>. This technique is also useful when an index
entry is to contain some non-Unicode character or glyph represented by
the <gi>g</gi> element discussed in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The Artist formerly
known as Prince  
<index><term sortKey="Prince"><g ref="#PrinceGlyph"/></term></index>...</p></egXML>
Note that if no value is supplied for the sortKey attribute, a sorting
application should always use the content of the <gi>term</gi> element
as a sort key.</p>
<!-- multiple indexes -->
<p>It is common practice to compile more than one index for a given text.
A biography of a poet, for example, may offer an index of references to
poems by the subject of the study, another index of works by other writers,
an index of places or historical personages etc. The indexName
attribute is used to assigning index terms and locations to one or
more specific indexes:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Sir John Ashford
<index indexName="INDEX-PERSONS"><term>Ashford, John</term></index> was,
coincidentally, born in 
<index indexName="INDEX-PLACES"><term>Ashford
(Kent)</term></index>Ashford...</p></egXML></p>
<!-- multi-level indexing -->
<p>Multi-level indexing is particularly common in scholarly
documents. For example, as well as entries
such as <term>TEI</term>, or <term>markup</term>, an index  may contain structured entries like <term>TEI,
markup practices, index terms</term>, where a top level entry <term>TEI</term>
is followed by a number of second-level subcategories, any or all of
which may have a third-level list attached to them and so on. In order to
reflect such a hierarchical index listing,  <gi>index</gi>  elements may be
nested to the required depth. For example,
suppose that we wish to make a structured index entry for
<q>lemmatisation</q> with subentries for <q>Arabic</q>,
<q>Sanskrit</q>, etc. The example at the start of this section  might
then be encoded with  nested
<gi>index</gi> elements:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The students understand procedures for Arabic lemmatisation
    <index>
   <term>lemmatization</term>
   <index>
     <term>arabic</term>
   </index>
</index>
...</p></egXML></p>
<p>The  index entry from Burton's <title>Anatomy of
Melancholy</title> quoted above might be generated in a similar way. 
<!--<q rend="display">Women, how cause of mel. 193; their vanity in apparell taxed, 527;
their counterfeit tears 547; their vices 601, commended, 624.</q> -->
To generate such an entry, the body of the text might include, at page
193, an <gi>index</gi> element such as
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
    <term>how cause of mel.</term>
    </index>
</index>
</egXML>. Similary,  page 601 of the body text would include
an <gi>index</gi> element like the following:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
      <term>their vices</term>
    </index>
</index></egXML>
while the <gi>index</gi> element at page 624 would have a structure
like the following:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
      <term>their vices</term>
      <index>
      <term>commended</term>
      </index>
    </index>
 </index></egXML>       
</p>
<p>When processing such <gi>index</gi> elements, the duplication
required to make the structure explicit will normally be removed, so
as to produce entries like those quoted above. However, this is not
required by the encoding recommended here. </p>
<!-- generating the index -->
<p>As noted above, the <gi>divGen</gi>
element may be  used to mark the place at which an index
generated from  <gi>index</gi> elements should be inserted into the
output of a processing program; typically but not necessarily this will be at some point
within the back matter of the document. The  <att>type</att> attribute
should be used to specify which kind of index is to be generated, and
its value should correspond with that of the
<att>indexName</att> attribute on the relevant <gi>index</gi>
elements. 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<back>
   <div type="appendix">
      <head>Bibliography</head>
      <listBibl>
         <bibl> ... </bibl>
      </listBibl>
   </div>
   <divGen n="Index Nominum" type="INDEX-NAMES"/>
   <divGen n="Index Loci" type="INDEX-PLACES"/>
</back></egXML>
 </p>
<p>As this example shows, the global
<att>n</att> attribute may also be used to specify a name or
identifier for the
generated index itself in the usual way. Any additional headings
etc. required for the generated index must be specified as content of
the <gi>divGen</gi> element.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<back>
   <divGen n="A1" type="INDEX-NAMES">
   <head>An Index of Names</head>
   </divGen>
</back>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>One final feature frequently found in manually-created indexes to
printed works cannot readily be encoded by the means provided here,
namely cross references internal to the index term listing. For
example, if all references to the TEI in a text have been indexed
using the index term <term>Text Encoding Initiative</term>, it may
also be helpful to include an entry under the term <term>TEI</term>
containing some text such as <q>see Text Encoding Initiative</q>. Such
internal cross-references must be added as part of the post-editing
phase for an auto-generated index.</p>
</div4>
<div4><head>Declarations</head>
<p>The formal declaration for these elements is as follows.
The <gi>index</gi> element is a member of the element class
<ident type="class">tei.metadata</ident> and may thus be used
anywhere within the <gi>text</gi> element.
<specGrp xml:id="DCONOIX" n="Index Entries">

</div2>
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COGR"><head>Graphics and other non-textual components</head>
<p>Graphics, such as illustrations or diagrams, appear in many
different kinds of text, and often with different purposes. In some
cases, the graphic is an integral part of a text (indeed, some texts &#x2014;
comic books for example &#x2014; may be almost entirely graphic); in others
the graphic may be a kind of optional extra. In some cases, the text
may be incomprehensible unless the graphic is included; in others, the
presence of the graphic adds very little to the sense of the
work. It will therefore be a matter of encoding policy as to whether
or how a graphic found in a source text is transferred to a digital
version of the same.  In documents which are <soCalled>born digital</soCalled>, graphics
and other forms of non-textual element may be particularly salient,
but their inclusion in an archival form of the document concerned
remains an editorial decision.</p>
<p>Considered as structural components, graphics may be anchored to a particular point in
the text, or they may <term>float</term> either completely freely, or
within some defined scope, such as a chapter or section. Graphics of
this kind often contain associated text such as a heading or label,
and may also nest hierarchically. These Guidelines recommend the following
different elements for these two cases:
<specList>
<specDesc key="graphic"/>
<specDesc key="figure"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>Graphic components may be encoded in a number of different ways:
<list>
<item>in some non-XML or binary format such as PNG, JPEG, etc.</item>
<item>in an XML format such as SVG</item>
<item>in a TEI XML format such as the notation for graphs and trees
described in <ptr target="#GD"/></item>
</list> In the last two cases, the  presence of the graphic
will be indicated by an appropriate XML element, drawn from the SVG
namespace in the second case, and its content will fully define the
graphic to be produced. In the first case, the element
<gi>graphic</gi> is used to mark the presence of the graphic only and the
visual content is stored outside the XML document, and its location is
referenced by means of an <att>url</att> attribute.</p>
<p>For example, the following passage indicates that a copy of the  image
found in the source text may be recovered from the URL
<ident>zigzag2.gif</ident>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>These were the four lines I moved in
through my first, second, third, and
fourth volumes.   -- In the fifth volume
I have been very good,   -- the precise
line I have described in it being this :     
<graphic url="zigzag2.gif"/>      
By which it appears, that except at the
curve, marked A. where I took a trip
to Navarre, -- and the indented curve B.
which is the short airing when I was

<p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element is a phrase level  element and may thus be used
anywhere  that textual content is permitted, within but not between
paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has
decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head>
</egXML>. </p>
<p>Floating graphics should be represented using the <gi>figure</gi>
element discussed in <ptr target="#FTGRA"/>.</p>
<p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element has the following formal definition:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOGR" n="Graphics">
&graphic.odd;
</specGrp>
</p> 
<p>The <gi>binaryObject</gi> element, which can be used to embed arbitrary
binary data representing (for instance) bitmap graphics, has the following formal definition:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOBOB" n="BinaryObject">
&binaryobject.odd;
</specGrp>
</p> 
</div2>	
<div2 type="section" xml:id="CORS"><head>Reference Systems</head>
<p>By <mentioned>reference system</mentioned> we mean the system by which names
or references are associated with particular passages of a text (e.g.
<mentioned>Ps. 23:3</mentioned> for the third verse of Psalm 23 or <mentioned>Amores
2.10.7</mentioned> for Ovid's <title>Amores</title>, book 2, poem 10, line
7).  Such names make it possible to mark a place within a text and
enable other readers to find it again.  A reference system may be based
on structural units (chapters, paragraphs, sentences; stanza and verse),
typographic units (page and line numbers), or divisions created
specifically for reference purposes (chapter and verse in Biblical
texts).  Where one exists, the traditional reference system for a text
should be preserved in an electronic transcript of it, if only to make
it easier to compare electronic and non-electronic versions of the text.
 </p>
<p>Reference systems may be recorded in TEI-encoded texts in any of the
following ways:
<list type="bullets">
<item>where a reference system exists, and is based on the same
logical structure as that of the text's markup, the reference for
a passage may be recorded as the value of the global <att>xml:id</att> or
<att>n</att> attribute on an appropriate tag, or may be constructed by
combining attribute values from several levels of tags, as described
below in section <ptr target="#CORS1" type="div3"/>.
 </item>
<item>where there is no pre-existing reference system, the global
<att>xml:id</att> or <att>n</att> attributes may be used to construct one
(e.g. collections and corpora created in electronic form), as described
below in section <ptr target="#CORS2" type="div3"/>.
 </item>
<item>where a reference system exists which is not based on the same
logical structure as that of the text's markup (for example, one
based on the page and line numbers of particular editions of the text
rather than on the structural divisions of it), any of a
variety of methods for encoding the logical structure representing
the reference system may be employed, as described in chapter
<ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </item>
<item>where a reference system exists which does not correspond to any
particular logical structure, or where the logical structure concerned
is of no interest to the encoder except as a means of supporting the
referencing system, then references may be encoded by means of
<gi>milestone</gi> elements, which simply mark points in the text at
which values in the reference system change, as described below in
section <ptr target="#CORS5" type="div3"/>.
 </item></list>
The specific method used to record traditional or new reference systems
for a text should be declared in the TEI header, as further described in
section <ptr target="#CORS6" type="div3"/> and in section <ptr target="#SACR"/>.
 </p>
<p>When a text has no pre-existing associated reference system of any
kind, these Guidelines recommend as a minimum that at least the page
boundaries of the source text be marked using one of the methods
outlined in this section.  Retaining page breaks in the markup is also
recommended for texts which have a detailed reference system of their
own. Line breaks in prose texts may be, but need not be,
tagged.<note place="foot">Many encoders find it convenient to retain the line breaks of
the original during data entry, to simplify proof-reading,
but this may be done without inserting a tag for each line
break of the original.</note></p>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CORS1"><head>Using the <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> Attributes</head>
<p>When traditional reference schemes represent a hierarchical
structuring of the text which mirrors that of the marked-up document, the
<att>n</att> attribute defined for all elements may be used to indicate
the traditional identifier of the relevant structural units. The
<att>n</att> attribute may also be used to record the numbering of
sections or list items in the copy text if the copy-text numbering is
important for some reason, for example because the numbers are out of
sequence.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional reference to Ovid's
<title>Amores</title> might be <mentioned>Amores
2.10.7</mentioned>&#x2014;book 2, poem 10, line 7. Book, poem, and
line are structural units of the work and will therefore be tagged in
any case. (See chapter <ptr target="#VE" type="div1"/> for a
discussion of structural units in verse collections.) In such cases,
it is convenient to record traditional reference numbers of the
structural units using the <att>n</att> attribute. The relevant tags
for our example would be:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div0 n="Amores" type="volume">
  <div1 n="1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div1>
  <div1 n="2" type="book">
      <div2 n="1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div2>
      <div2 n="2" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div2>
      <!-- ... -->
      <div2 n="10" type="poem">
          <l n="1"> ... </l>
          <l n="2"> ... </l>
          <!-- ... -->
          <l n="7"> ... </l>
      </div2>
      <!-- ... -->
  </div1>
  <!-- ... -->
</div0></egXML>
 </p>
<p>One may also place the entire standard reference for each portion of
the text into the appropriate value for the <att>n</att> attribute,
though for obvious reasons this takes more space in the file:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div0 n="Amores" type="volume">
  <div1 n="Amores 1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div1>
  <div1 n="Amores 2" type="book">
    <div2 n="Amores 2.1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div2>
    <!-- ... -->
    <div2 n="Amores 2.10" type="poem">
      <!-- ... -->
      <l n="Amores 2.10.7"> ... </l>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div2>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div1>
  <!-- ... -->
</div0></egXML>
 </p>
<p>If the names used by the traditional reference system can be
formulated as identifiers, then the references can be given as values
for the <att>xml:id</att> attribute; this requires that the reference
be given without internal spaces, begin with a letter or underscore,
and contain no characters other than letters, digits, hyphens,
underscores, full stops, and the various combining and extender
characters.<note place="foot" resp="sdb">For a complete list see the
<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-CombiningChar">XML
specification</ref> productions 87 &amp; 89.</note> Unlike values for
the <att>n</att> attribute, values for the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
must be unique throughout the document. Our example then looks like
this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div0 n="Amores" type="volume">
  <div1 xml:id="am.1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div1>
  <div1 xml:id="am.2" type="book">
    <div2 xml:id="am.2.1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div2>
    <!-- ... -->
    <div2 xml:id="am.2.10" type="poem">
      <!-- ... -->
      <l xml:id="am.2.10.7"> ... </l>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div2>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div1>
  <!-- ... -->
</div0></egXML>
 </p>
<p>To document the usage and to allow automatic processing of these
standard references, it is recommended that the TEI header be used to
declare whether standard references are recorded in the <att>n</att> or
<att>xml:id</att> attributes and which elements may carry standard
references or portions of them. For examples of declarations for the
reference systems just shown, see section <ptr target="#CORS6" type="div3"/>.
 </p>
<p>Using the <att>n</att> attribute one can specify only a single
standard referencing system, a limitation not without problems, since
some editions may define structural units differently and thus create
alternative reference systems.  For example, another edition of the
<title>Amores</title> considers poem 10 a continuation of poem 9, and
therefore would specify the same line as <mentioned>Amores 2.9.31</mentioned>.
In order to record both of these reference systems  one
could employ any of a variety of methods discussed in chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CORS2"><head>Creating New Reference Systems</head>
<p>If a text has no canonical reference system of its own, a reference
system, if needed, may be derived from the structure of the electronic
text, specifically from the markup of the text.  As with any
reference system intended for long-term use, it is important to see the
reference as an established, unchanging point in the text.  Should the
text be revised or rearranged, the reference-system identifiers
associated with any bit of text must stay with that bit of text, even if
it means the reference numbers fall out of sequence.  (A new reference
system may always be created beside the old one if out-of-sequence
numbers must be avoided.)
 </p>
<p>The global attributes <att>n</att> and <att>xml:id</att> may be used to
assign reference identifiers to segments of the text.  Identifiers
specified by either attribute apply to the entire element for which they
are given.  ID attributes must be unique within a single
document, and ID values must begin with a letter.  No such restrictions
are made on the values of <att>n</att> attributes.
 </p>
<p>A convenient method of mechanically generating unique values for
<att>xml:id</att> or <att>n</att> attributes based on the structure of
the document is to construct, for each element, a <term>domain-style
address</term> comprising a series of components separated by full
stops, with one component for each level of the document hierarchy.
Two methods may be used.  In the <term>typed path</term> form of
identifier, each component in the identifier takes the form <ident type="var">element-type</ident> <mentioned>-</mentioned> <ident type="var">number</ident>.  The element name specifies what type of
element is to be sought, and the number specifies which occurrence of that
element type is to be selected.  (The hyphen and number may be omitted
if there is only one element of the given type.)  In the <term>untyped
path</term> form of identifier, each component consists of a number,
indicating which element in the sequence of nodes at each level is to be
selected.  <!--A fixed prefix beginning with a letter may be used to make
the untyped path legal as an <code type="kw">ID</code> value.-->
 </p>
<p>Identifiers generated with these methods should use the <gi>text</gi>
element as their starting point, rather than the <gi>TEI</gi> or
<gi>body</gi> elements. The <gi>TEI</gi> element may be taken
as a starting point only if identifiers need to be generated for the
<gi>teiHeader</gi>, which is not usually the case;  using the
<gi>body</gi> element as a root would prevent assignment of identifiers
for the front and back matter.  The component corresponding to the root
element can be omitted from identifiers, if no confusion will result.
In collections and corpora, the component corresponding to the root may
be replaced by the unique identifier assigned to the text or sample.
 </p>
<p>In the following example, each element within the <gi>text</gi>
element has been given a typed-path identifier as its <att>xml:id</att>
value, and an untyped-path identifier as its <att>n</att> value; the
latter are prefixed with the string <mentioned>AB</mentioned>, which may be
imagined to be the general identifier for this text.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text xml:id="Text-1" n="AB">
  <front xml:id="Front" n="AB.1">
    <div xml:id="Front.div-1" n="AB.1.1">
      <p> ... </p> 
    </div>
    <titlePage xml:id="Front.titlePage" n="AB.1.2">
      <titlePart> ... </titlePart>       
    </titlePage>
    <div xml:id="Front.div-2" n="AB.1.3">
      <p> ... </p> 
    </div>
  </front>
  <body xml:id="Body" n="AB.2">
    <p xml:id="Body.p-1" n="AB.2.1"> ... </p>
    <p xml:id="Body.p-2" n="AB.2.2"> ... </p>
    <div xml:id="Body.div-1" n="AB.2.3">
      <head xml:id="Body.div-1.head" n="AB.2.3.1"> ... </head>
      <p xml:id="Body.div-1.p-1" n="AB.2.3.2"> ... </p>
      <p xml:id="Body.div-1.p-2" n="AB.2.3.3"> ... </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="Body.div-2" n="AB.2.4">
      <head xml:id="Body.div-2.head" n="AB.2.4.1"> ... </head>
      <p xml:id="Body.div-2.p-1" n="AB.2.4.2"> ... </p>
      <p xml:id="Body.div-2.p-2" n="AB.2.4.3"> ... </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</text></egXML>
The typed and untyped path methods are convenient, but are in no way
required for anyone creating a reference system.
 </p>
<p>If the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is used to record the reference
identifiers generated, each value should record the entire path.  If the
<att>n</att> attribute is used, each value may record either the entire
path or only the subpath from the parent element.  The attribute
used, the elements which can bear standard reference identifiers, and
the method for constructing standard reference identifiers, should all
be declared in the header as described in section <ptr target="#HD54"/>.
 </p>
<p>When the hierarchy of the encoded document and that of the
reference system differ (e.g. for reference systems based on page and
line numbers) or when more than one reference system is to be encoded,
the encoder of an SGML (but not XML) TEI text may choose to represent the alternative reference system(s)
as elements in one or more concurrent document hierarchies.  For an
introduction to the concept of concurrent hierarchies, see <!--the
discussion of the <code type="kw">CONCUR</code> feature in --> section <ptr target="#SG152" type="div1"/>.  For further discussion of this and other
mechanisms, see chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CORS5"><head>Milestone Tags</head><p>Often concurrent markup is not a viable method because the document is XML, 
the available SGML
parser does not support the <ident>CONCUR</ident> feature, or
the desired reference
system does not correspond to any particular structural hierarchy. In
these cases it is often desirable to mark up changes in the reference system by using
one or more of the following <term>milestone</term> elements:
<specList><specDesc key="milestone" /><specDesc key="pb"/><specDesc key="lb"/><specDesc key="cb"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>These elements simply mark the points in a text at which some
category in a reference system changes.  They have no content but
subdivide the text into regions, rather in the same way as milestones
divide a road into segments.  The elements <gi>pb</gi>, <gi>cb</gi>,
and <gi>lb</gi> are provided to mark specific types of milestone,
namely page, column, and line boundaries, as further described in
chapter <ptr target="#PH" type="div1"/>.  The global <att>n</att> attribute is
used in each case to provide a value for the value (for example, the
page or line number).  Validation of a reference
system based on <gi>milestone</gi> tags is not directly provided by SGML or XML 
parsers, so it will be the
responsibility of the encoder or the application software to ensure
that milestone tags occur in a correct order.</p>
<p>Milestone tags may be useful where a text has two competing
structures. For example, many English novels were first published as
serial works, individual parts of which do not always contain a whole
number of chapters. An encoder may decide to represent the
chapter-based  structure using <gi>div1</gi> elements, with
<gi>milestone</gi> elements to mark the points at which individual
parts end; or the reverse. Thus, an encoding in which chapters are
regarded as more important than parts might encode some work in which
chapter three begins in part one and is concluded in part two as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text><body>
    <milestone unit="part"/>
    <div1 n="1" type="chapter">
<!-- ... -->      
    </div1>
    <div1 n="2" type="chapter">
<!-- ... -->      
    </div1>
    <div1 n="3">
<!-- ... -->      
       <milestone unit="part"/>
<!-- ... -->      
    </div1>
  </body></text></egXML>
An encoding of the same work in which parts are regarded as more
important than chapters might begin as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text>
  <body>
    <div1 n="1" type="part">
      <milestone unit="chapter"/>
      <p>
        <milestone unit="chapter"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <milestone unit="chapter"/>
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
    </div1>
    <div1 n="2" type="part">
      <p>
        <milestone unit="chapter"/>
      </p>
    </div1>
  </body>
</text></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Milestone tags also make it possible to record the reference systems
used in a number of different editions of the same work. The reference
system of any one edition can be recreated from a text in which all are
marked by simply ignoring all elements that do not specify that edition
on their <att>ed</att> attribute.
 </p>
<p>As a simple example, assuming that edition E1 of some collection of
poems regards the first two poems as constituting the first book, while
edition E2 regards the first poem as prefatory, a markup scheme like
the following might be adopted:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone ed="E1" unit="work"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="work"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="book"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="poem"/>
  </egXML>
 </p>
<p>In this case no <att>n</att> value is specified, since the numbers
rise predictably and the application can keep a count from the start of
the document, if desired.
 </p>
<p>The value of the <att>n</att> attribute may but need not include the
identifiers used for any larger sections.  That is, either of the
following styles is legitimate:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone n="Amores" ed="E1" unit="work"/>
<milestone n="1" ed="E1" unit="book"/>
<milestone n="1" ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone n="2" ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone n="3" ed="E1" unit="book"/></egXML>
or
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone n="Amores" ed="E1" unit="work"/>
<milestone n="1" ed="E1" unit="book"/>
<milestone n="1.1" ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone n="1.2" ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone n="1.3" ed="E1" unit="book"/></egXML>
 </p>
<p>When using <gi>milestone</gi> tags, line numbers may be supplied for
every line or only periodically (every fifth, every tenth line).  The
latter may be simpler; the former is more reliable.
 </p>
<p>The style of numbering used in the values of <att>n</att> is
unrestricted:  for the example above, <val>I.i</val>, <val>I.ii</val>, and <val>I.iii</val> could have been
used equally well if preferred.  The special value <val>unnumbered</val> should be reserved for marking sections of
text which fall outside the normal numbering system (e.g. chapter heads,
poem numbers, titles, or speaker attributions in a verse drama).
 </p>
<p>Because the <att>ed</att> attribute is unrestricted, no change need be
made to the document type declaration of a file before adding tags to
describe a new reference system.  (The value of <att>ed</att> may be
restricted to a defined set of edition symbols by using the techniques
described in chapter <ptr target="#MD" type="div1"/>.)
 </p>
<p>See below, section <ptr target="#CORS6" type="div3"/>, for examples of
declarations for the reference systems just shown.
 </p>
<p>The milestone elements are formally defined
as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCORSM" n="Milestone tags">
&milest.odd;
&pagebr.odd;
&linebr.odd;
&colbr.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="CORS6"><head>Declaring Reference Systems</head>
<p>Whatever kind of reference system is used in an electronic text, it
is recommended that the TEI header contain a description of its
construction in the <gi>refsDecl</gi> element described in section
<ptr target="#HD54" type="div3"/>. As described there, the declaration
may consist either of a formal declaration using the
<gi>fragmentPattern</gi> element or an informal description in prose.
The former is recommended because unlike prose it can be processed by
software.</p>
<p>The three examples given in section <ptr target="#CORS1"
type="div3"/> would be declared as follows. The first example encodes
the standard references for Ovid's <title>Amores</title> one level at
a time, using the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>div0</gi>,
<gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>, and <gi>l</gi> tags. The header for such
an encoding should look something like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader>
    <fileDesc><!-- ... --></fileDesc>
    <encodingDesc>
         <refsDecl>
           <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)"
			    pat="#xpath(//div0[@n='$1']/div1[@n='$2']/div2[@n='$3']/l[@n='$4']">
	     <p>A canonical reference is assembled with
	     <list>
	       <item>the name of the <label>work</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a <gi>div0</gi>,</item>
	       <item>a space,</item>
	       <item>the number of the <label>book</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a child <gi>div1</gi>,</item>
	       <item>a full stop</item>
	       <item>the number of the <label>poem</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a child <gi>div2</gi>,</item>
	       <item>the line number: the <att>n</att> value of a
	       child <gi>l</gi></item>
	     </list>
	     </p>
	   </fragmentPattern>
           <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)"
			    pat="#xpath(//div0[@n='$1']/div1[@n='$2']/div2[@n='$3']">
	     <p>Same as above, but without the last component (full
	     stop follwed by the <gi>l</gi>'s <att>n</att>.</p>
	   </fragmentPattern>
           <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)"
			    pat="#xpath(//div0[@n='$1']/div1[@n='$2']">
	     <p>Same as above, but without the poem component (full
	     stop follwed by the <gi>div2</gi>'s <att>n</att>.</p>
	   </fragmentPattern>
         </refsDecl>         
    </encodingDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The second example encodes the same reference system, again using the
<att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>div0</gi>, <gi>div1</gi>,
<gi>div2</gi>, and <gi>l</gi> tags, but giving the reference string in
full on each tag. If canonical references are made only to lines, the
reference system could be declared as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)"
		   pat="#xpath(//l[@n='$1')"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
Since the entire regular expression is enclosed as a parenthetical
subgroup, the entire canonical reference string is sought as the value
of the <att>n</att> attribute on an <gi>l</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>In order to handle references to poems as well as to individual
lines, the declaration for the reference system must be more
complicated:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)"
		   pat="#xpath(//l[@n='$1')"/>
  <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+)"
		   pat="#xpath(//div2[@n='$1')"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
This declaration indicates that the entire reference string must be
sought as the value of the <att>n</att> attribute on a <gi>div0</gi>,
<gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>, or <gi>l</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>The third example encodes the same reference system, this time
giving the entire reference string as the value of the
<att>xml:id</att> attribute on the relevant tags. The reference system
declaration for such an encoding could be:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <fragmentPattern re="(.*)"
		   pat="#$1"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
although in general there seems to be little advantage in this case:
it is no more difficult to use a standard relative URI reference as
the value of <att>target</att>.</p>
<p>Reference systems recorded by means of milestone tags can also be
declared; the following prose description could be used to declare
the example given in section <ptr target="#CORS5" type="div3"/>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
   <p>Standard references to work, book, poem, and line may be
     constructed from the milestone tags in the text.</p>
</refsDecl></egXML>
Or in this way, using a formal declaration for this reference scheme
derived from edition <val>E1</val>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
   <state ed="E1" unit="work" delim=" "/>
   <state ed="E1" unit="book" delim="."/>
   <state ed="E1" unit="poem" delim=":"/>
   <state ed="E1" unit="line"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
 </p>
<p>This is synonymous with the following declaration using the
<gi>fragmentPattern</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <fragmentPattern re="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)"
		   pat="???"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
<?tei winita need to replace ??? above with something equivalent to:
<refsDecl>
   <step refunit="work" delim=" "

	 to="FOLLOWING (1 MILESTONE EDITION E1 UNIT work)"/>
   <step refunit="book" delim="."

	 to="FOLLLOWING (1 MILESTONE EDITION E1 UNIT line)"/>
</refsDecl> ?>
</p></div3></div2>
<div2 type="section" xml:id="COBI"><head>Bibliographic Citations and References</head>
<p>Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic
items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or
pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text.  They are
required at several points within the TEI Header's source description,
as discussed in section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; they may also appear within
the body of a text, either singly (for example within a footnote), or
collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text.
 </p>
<p>In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic
reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the
flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special
punctuation conventions, underlining, etc.  In electronic texts, such
distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably
formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,<note place="foot">For example, to distinguish <mentioned>London</mentioned> as an
author's name from <mentioned>London</mentioned> as a place of publication or as
a component of a title.</note> quite apart from the need to distinguish
the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic
properties.
 </p>
<p>It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual
features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should
be formatted when it is printed.  The distinctions permitted by the
scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular
formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove
adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.<note place="foot">Among the bibliographic software systems and
subsystems consulted in the design of the <gi>biblStruct</gi> structure
were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite.  The distinctions made by all three
may be preserved in <gi>biblStruct</gi> structures, though the nature of
their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data
elements to TEI elements.  For further information, see section <ptr target="#COBIOT"/>.</note> The features distinguished and described below
(in section <ptr target="#COBICO"/>) constitute a set which has been useful
for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and
which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic
and library cataloguing practice.  For a fuller account of that practice
as applied to electronic texts see section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; for a
brief mention of related library standards see section <ptr target="#HD8"/>.
 </p>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COBITY"><head>Elements of Bibliographic References</head>
<p>The following elements are used to mark individual bibliographic
references as wholes, or in groups:
<specList>
<specDesc key="bibl"/>
<specDesc key="biblItem"/>
<specDesc key="biblStruct"/>
<specDesc key="biblFull"/>
<specDesc key="listBibl"/>
</specList>
These elements all share a number of possible component sub-elements.
For the <gi>bibl</gi> and <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements, exactly the
same sub-elements are concerned, and they are described together in
section <ptr target="#COBICO"/>; for the <gi>biblFull</gi> element, the
sub-elements concerned are fully described in section <ptr target="#HD2"/>.
 </p>
<p>Different levels of specific tagging may be appropriate in different
situations.  In some cases, it may be felt necessary to mark just the
extent of the reference itself, with perhaps a few distinctions being
made within it (for example, between the part of the reference which
identifies a title or author and the rest).  Such references, containing
a mixture of text with specialized bibliographic elements, are regarded
as <gi>bibl</gi> elements, and tagged accordingly.  For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>A book which had a great influence on him
was <bibl>Tufte's <title>Envisioning
Information</title></bibl>, although he may
never have actually read it.</p></egXML>
Indeed, some encoders may find it unnecessary to mark the bibliographic
reference at all:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>A book which had a great influence on him
was Tufte's <title>Envisioning Information</title>,
although he may never have actually read it.</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Some bibliographic references are extremely elliptical, often only a
string of the form <mentioned>Baxter, 1983</mentioned>.  If no further details of
Baxter's book are given in the source text and none are supplied by the
encoder, then the reference thus given should be tagged as a
<gi>bibl</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">All of this is of course much more fully treated
in <bibl>Baxter, 1983</bibl><![CDATA[.]]></egXML>
In general, however, normal modern bibliographic practice, and these
Guidelines, distinguish between a bibliographic <term rend="noindex">reference</term>,<index><term>references</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index><index><term>bibliographic references</term></index>
which is a self-sufficient description of a bibliographic item, and a
bibliographic <term rend="noindex">pointer</term>,<index><term>bibliographic pointers</term></index><index><term>pointers</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>
which is a short-form citation (e.g. <mentioned>Baxter,
1983</mentioned>) which serves usually as a place-holder or pointer to
a full long-form reference found elsewhere in the text.  The usual
encoding of short-form references such as <mentioned>Baxter,
1983</mentioned> is not as <gi>bibl</gi> elements but as
cross-references to such elements; see section <ptr target="#COBIXR"/>
below.  </p> <p>In cases where the encoder wishes to impose more structure on the
bibliographic information, for example to make sure it conforms to a
particular style-sheet or retrieval processor, the <gi>biblStruct</gi>
element should be used.  Note that several of the features in this and
later examples are explained later in the current section.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblStruct>
   <monogr>
      <author>Edward R. Tufte</author>

         <date>1990</date>
      </imprint>
   </monogr>
</biblStruct></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The highest level of detail and the most complex structure supported
by the current proposals is provided by the <gi>biblFull</gi> element,
which closely resembles the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element of the TEI Header
(section <ptr target="#HD2"/>).
<!-- biblFull needs an analytic level. -MSM -->
	<!-- titstmt requires title first -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblFull>

<!-- MSM! please check/expand on these details: you have the book!  -->
	<!-- Done.  Robinson corrected to Rolf, bracketed (titlep has R.)   -->
 </p>
<p>A list of bibliographic items, of whatever kind, may be treated in
the same way as any other list (see section <ptr target="#COLI"/>).
Alternatively, the specialized <gi>listBibl</gi> element may be used.
The difference between the two is that a <gi>list</gi> contains
<gi>item</gi> elements, within which bibliographic elements (<gi>bibl</gi>,
<gi>biblStruct</gi> or <gi>biblFull</gi>) may appear, as well as other
phrase- and paragraph-level elements, whereas the <gi>listBibl</gi> may
contain only bibliographic elements, optionally preceded by a heading and a
series of introductory paragraphs.  The former would be appropriate
for a list of bibliographic elements in which descriptive prose
predominated, and the latter for a more formal bibliography.  The
following are thus both legal encodings of a list of bibliographic
entries:  a <gi>listBibl</gi>:
<!-- <note place='foot'>In these examples, white space has      -->
	<!-- been liberally used to help indicate the structure of    -->
	<!-- the entries; it is not required and is not necessarily   -->
	<!-- used in practice.  </note>                               -->

<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COBICO"><head>Components of Bibliographic References</head>
<p>This section discusses a number of very commonly occurring component

<item>titles of various kinds, and statements of intellectual
responsibility (authorship, etc.)</item>
<item>information relating to the publication, pagination, etc. of an
item</item>
<item>annotation, commentary, and further detail</item></list>
The following sections describe the elements which may be used to
represent such information within a <gi>bibl</gi> or
<gi>biblStruct</gi> element.  Within the former, any or all of these
may be used and in any order.  Within the latter, such of these elements
as exist for a given reference must be distinguished, and must also be
presented in a specific order, discussed further below (section <ptr target="#COBICOO"/>).
 </p>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBICOL"><head>Analytic, Monographic, and Series Levels</head>
<p>In common library practice a clear distinction is made between an
individual item within a larger collection and a free-standing book,
journal, or collection.  Similarly a book in a series is distinguished
sharply from the series within which it appears.  An article forming
part of a collection which itself appears in a series thus has a
bibliographic description with three quite distinct levels of
information:
<list type="ordered">
<item>the <term rend="noindex">analytic</term><index><term>analytic level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>
level, giving the title, author, etc., of the article;
 </item>
<item>the <term rend="noindex">monographic</term><index><term>monographic level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>
level, giving the title, editor, etc., of the collection;
 </item>
<item>the <term rend="noindex">series</term><index><term>series level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>
level, giving the title of the series, possibly the names of its
editors, etc., and the number of the volume within that series.
 </item></list>
In the same way, an article in a journal requires at least two levels of
information:  the analytic level describing the article itself, and the
monographic level describing the journal.
 </p>
<p>These three levels may be distinguished within a <gi>bibl</gi>
element, and must be distinguished within a <gi>biblStruct</gi> element
if present, by means of the following tags:
 <?tei winita
<specList><specDesc key="analytic"/><specDesc key="monogr"/><specDesc key="series"/></specList> --> ?>
 </p>
<p>For purposes of TEI encoding, journals and anthologies are both
treated as monographs; a journal title will thus be tagged as a <gi>title
level="j"</gi> element, or simply as a <gi>title</gi> within a <gi>monogr</gi> element.  Individual articles in the
journal or collected texts should be treated at the
<soCalled>analytic</soCalled> level.  When an article has been printed
in more than one journal or collection, the bibliographic reference may
have more than one <gi>monogr</gi> element, each possibly followed by
one or more <gi>series</gi> elements.  A <gi>series</gi> element always
relates to the most recently preceding <gi>monogr</gi> element.
(Whether reprints of an article are treated in the same bibliographic
reference or a separate one varies among different styles.  Library
lists typically use a different entry for each publication, while
academic footnoting practice typically treats all publications of the
same article in a single entry.)
 </p>
<p>For example, the article cited in this example has been published
twice, once in a journal and once in a collection which appeared in a
German language series:

 </p>
<p>Punctuation may not appear between the elements within a structured
bibliographic entry; if punctuation is to be given explicitly in the
encoding, it must be contained within the elements it delimits.  As the
example shows, it is possible to encode the entry without any
inter-element punctuation:  this facilitates use of the
<gi>biblStruct</gi> element in systems which can render bibliographic
references in any of several styles.
 </p>
<p>The formal declarations for the elements defined in this section are
as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOBILV" n="Levels of bibliographic information">
&analytic.odd;
&monogr.odd;
&series.odd;
</specGrp>
 </p></div4>
<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBICOR"><head>Authors, Titles, and Editors</head>
<p>Bibliographic references typically begin with a statement of the
title being cited and the names of those intellectually responsible for
it.  For articles in journals or collections, such statements should
appear both for the analytic and for the monographic level.  The
following elements are provided for tagging such elements:
<specList><specDesc key="title" /><specDesc key="author"/><specDesc key="editor"/><specDesc key="respStmt"/><specDesc key="resp"/><specDesc key="name"/><specDesc key="meeting"/></specList>
  </p>
<p>In bibliographic references, all titles should be tagged as such,
whether analytic, monographic, or series titles.  The single element
<gi>title</gi> is used for all these cases.  When it appears directly
within an <gi>analytic</gi>, <gi>monogr</gi>, or <gi>series</gi>
element, <gi>title</gi> is interpreted as belonging to the appropriate
level.  When it appears elsewhere, its <att>level</att> attribute should
be used to signal its bibliographic level.  It is a semantic error to
give a value for the <att>level</att> attribute which is inconsistent
with the context; such values may be ignored.  The <att>level</att>
value <val>a</val> implies the analytic level; the values
<val>m</val>, <val>j</val>, and <val>u</val> imply the monographic level; the value <val>s</val> implies the series level.  Note, however, that the
semantic error occurs only if the nested title is directly enclosed by
the <gi>analytic</gi>, <gi>monogr</gi>, or <gi>series</gi> element; if
it is enclosed only indirectly, no semantic error need be present.  For
example, the analytic title may contain a monographic title:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblStruct>
   <analytic>
      <author>Lucy Allen Paton</author>
      <title>Notes on Manuscripts of the 
         <title level="m" xml:lang="fr">Proph&#xE9;cies de Merlin</title>
      </title>
   </analytic>
   <monogr>
      <title level="j">PMLA</title>
      <imprint>
         <biblScope type="vol">8</biblScope>
         <date>1913</date>
         <biblScope type="pages">122</biblScope>
      </imprint>
   </monogr>
</biblStruct></egXML>
In this case, the analytic title <q>Notes on Manuscripts of the
<title>Proph&#xE9;cies de Merlin</title></q> needs no <att>level</att>
attribute because it is directly contained by the <gi>analytic</gi>
level; the monographic title contained within it, <q>Proph&#xE9;cies
de Merlin,</q> does not create a semantic error because it is not
directly contained by the <gi>analytic</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>In some bibliographic applications, it may prove useful to
distinguish main titles from subordinate titles, parallel titles, etc.
The <att>type</att> attribute is provided to allow this distinction to
be recorded.
 </p>
<p>The following reference, from a national standard for bibliographic
references,<note place="foot">American National Standard for
Bibliographic References, ANSI Z39.29-1977 (New York:  American
National Standards Institute, 1977), p. 34 (sec.
A.2.2.1).</note>
illustrates this type of analysis with its distinction between main
and subordinate titles. Note that this uses the more flexible
<gi>bibl</gi>, rather than the structured <gi>biblStruct</gi>
element: consequently, there is no requirement to tag all the
components of the reference (notably the authors).

 </p>
<p>Slightly more complex is the distinction made below among main,
subordinate, and parallel titles, in an example from the same source (p.
63).  The punctuation and the bibliographic analysis are those given in
ANSI Z39.29-1977; the punctuation is in the style prescribed by the
International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD).<note place="foot">The analysis is not wholly unproblematic:  as the text of the
standard points out, the first subordinate title is subordinate only to
the parallel title in French, while the second is subordinate to both
the English main title and the French parallel title, without this
relationship being made clear, either in the markup given in the example
or in the reference structure offered by the standard.</note> Again,
it is only because this example uses <gi>bibl</gi> rather than <gi>biblStruct</gi>,
that specific punctuation may be included between the component
elements of the reference.

 </p>
<p>The elements <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> have, for printed
books and articles, a fairly obvious significance; for other kinds of
bibliographic items their proper usage may be less obvious.  The
<gi>author</gi> element should be used for the person or agency with
primary responsibility for a work's intellectual content, and the
element <gi>editor</gi> for an editor of the work.  Thus an organization
such as a radio or television station is usually accounted
<soCalled>author</soCalled> of a broadcast, for example, while the
author of a Government report will usually be the agency which produced
it.
 </p>
<p>For anyone else with responsibility for the work, the
<gi>respStmt</gi> element should be used. The nature of the
responsibility is indicated by means of a <gi>resp</gi> element, and
the person, organization, etc. responsible by a <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>persName</gi>, or <gi>orgName</gi> element. Strings such as
<q>unknwon</q> may be encoded using the <gi>rs</gi> element.
<!-- I'm mildly unahppy with this <rs>unknown</rs>, as it's not really a noun, is it? -sb -->
At least one of the four naming elements (<gi>name</gi>,
<gi>persName</gi>, <gi>orgName</gi>, or <gi>rs</gi> &mdash; at present
the TEI schema files also permit <gi>geogName</gi> and
<gi>placeName</gi>, but these should not be used) and one
<gi>resp</gi> element should be given within the <gi>respStmt</gi>
element, followed optionally by any number of any of them.</p>
<p>Examples of
secondary responsibility of this kind include the roles of
illustrator, translator, encoder, and annotator. The <gi>respStmt</gi>
element may also be used for editors, if it is desired to record the
specific terms in which their role is described.</p>
<p>Examples of <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may be found in
sections <ptr target="#COBITY"/>, and <ptr target="#COBICOL"/>; wherever
<gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may occur, the <gi>respStmt</gi>
element may also occur. When one of these elements precedes or
immediately follows a title, it applies to that title; when it follows
an <gi>edition</gi> element or occurs within an edition statement, it
applies to the edition in question.
 </p>
<p>In this example, the <gi>respStmt</gi> elements apply to the work as
a whole, not merely to the first edition:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><bibl>

   </note>
</bibl></egXML>
<!-- from ISO 690: 1987, clause 4.1, p. 2. -->
 </p>
<p>In this example, by contrast, the <gi>respStmt</gi> element applies
to the edition, and not to the collection per se (Moser and Tervooren
were not responsible for the first thirty-five printings); the elements
of the reference have been reordered from their appearance on the title
page of the volume in order to ensure the correct relationship of the
collection title, the edition statement, and the statement of
responsibility.

<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBICOI"><head>Imprint, Pagination, and Other Details</head>
<p>By <mentioned>imprint</mentioned> is meant all the information relating to the
publication of a work:  the person or organization by whose authority
and in whose name a bibliographic entity such as a book is made public
or distributed (whether a commercial publisher or some other
organization), the place of publication, and a date.  It may also
include a full address for the publisher or organization.
Full bibliographic references usually specify either the number of pages
in a print publication (or equivalent information for non-print
materials), or the specific location of the material being cited within
its containing publication.  The following elements are provided to hold
this information:
<specList><specDesc key="imprint"/><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="pubPlace"/><specDesc key="publisher"/><specDesc key="date"/><specDesc key="idno" /><specDesc key="extent"/><specDesc key="biblScope" /></specList>
 </p>
<p>For bibliographic purposes, usually only the place (or places) of
publication are required, possibly including the name of the country,
rather than a full address; the element <gi>pubPlace</gi> is provided
for this purpose.
Where however the full postal address is likely to be of importance in
identifying or locating the bibliographic item concerned, it may be
supplied and tagged using the <gi>address</gi> element described in
section <ptr target="#CONAAD"/>.  Alternatively, if desired, the<gi>rs</gi> or <gi>name</gi> elements described in section <ptr target="#CONARS"/> 
may be used; this involves no claim that the information
given is either a full address or the name of a city.
 </p>
<p>The name of the publisher of an item should be marked using the
<gi>publisher</gi> tag even if the item is made public
(<soCalled>published</soCalled>) by an organization other than a
conventional publisher, as is frequently the case with technical
reports:

 </p>
<p>A bibliographic description, particularly for an analytic title, will
often include some additional information specifying its location, for
example as a volume number, page number, range of page numbers, or name
or number of a subdivision of the host work.  The element
<gi>biblScope</gi> may be used to identify such information if it is
present.  Where it is desired to distinguish different classes of such
information (volume number, page number, chapter number, etc.), the
<att>type</att> attribute may be used with any convenient typology.
 </p>
<p>When the item being cited is a journal article, the <gi>imprint</gi>
element describing the issue in which it appeared will typically contain
<gi>biblScope</gi> elements for volume and page numbers, together with a
<gi>date</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblStruct>
   <analytic>

      <title>Parish registers and the historian</title>
   </analytic>
   <monogr>

      <title>National index of parish registers</title>
      <imprint>

<specList><specDesc key="note" /></specList>

<div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBICOO"><head>Order of Components within References</head>
<p>The order of elements in <gi>bibl</gi> elements is not constrained.
 </p>
<p>In <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements, the <gi>analytic</gi> element, if
it occurs, must come first, followed by one or more <gi>monogr</gi> and
<gi>series</gi> elements, which may appear intermingled (as long as a
<gi>monogr</gi> element comes first).  Within <gi>analytic</gi>, the
title(s), author(s), editor(s), and other statements of responsibility
may appear in any order; it is recommended that all forms of the title
be given together.  Within <gi>monogr</gi>, the author, editor, and
statements of responsibility may either come first or else follow the
monographic title(s).  Following these, the elements must appear in the
following order:
<list type="simple">
<item><gi>note</gi>s on the publication (and <gi>meeting</gi> elements
describing the conference, in the case of a proceedings volume)</item>
<item><gi>edition</gi> elements, each followed by any related
<gi>editor</gi> or <gi>respStmt</gi> elements</item>
<item><gi>imprint</gi></item>
<item><gi>biblScope</gi></item></list>
Within <gi>imprint</gi>, the elements allowed may appear in any
order.</p>
<p>Finally, within the <gi>series</gi> information in a
<gi>biblStruct</gi>, the sequence of elements is not constrained.
 </p>
<p>If more detailed structuring of a bibliographic description is
required, the <gi>biblFull</gi> element should be used.  This is not
further described here, as its contents are essentially equivalent to
those of the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, which
is fully described in section <ptr target="#HD2"/>.
 </p></div4></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COBIXR"><head>Bibliographic Pointers </head>
<p>References which are pointers to bibliographic items, of whatever
kind, should be treated in the same way as other cross-references (see
section <ptr target="#COXR"/>).  As discussed in that section, cross
referencing within TEI texts is in general represented by means of
<gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> elements.  An <att>href</att> attribute on
these elements is used to supply an identifying value for the target of
the cross reference, which should be, in the case of bibliographic
elements, a bibliographic reference of some kind.  Where the form of the
reference itself is unimportant, or may be reconstructed mechanically,
or is not to be encoded, the <gi>ptr</gi> element is used, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">As shown above (<ptr target="#NEL80"/><![CDATA[) ...]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Where the form of the reference is important, or contains additional
qualifying information which is to be kept but distinguished from the
surrounding text, the <gi>ref</gi> element should be used, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nelson claims <ref target="#NEL80">(ibid, passim)</ref><![CDATA[ ...]]></egXML>
<!--Following suggestion is only possible if <biblScope> becomes a phrase. -->
	<!--Which it currently isnt.  -->
	<!--<p>When it is desired to distinguish the short form of the reference -->
	<!--itself from the additional qualifying information added to it, the -->
	<!--additional information may be marked as a <gi>biblScope</gi> element: -->
	<!--  -->
	<!--<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">-->
	<!--Nelson claims (<ref target='NEL80'>Nelson [1980], <biblScope>especially -->
	<!--pages 13&ndash;37</ref>) ... -->
	<!--]]> -->
	<!--</egXML> -->
	<!--  -->
	<!--(This distinction between the short form and the qualifying information -->
	<!--may be useful in the context of document production or normalization of -->
	<!--bibliographic references.) -->
It may be important to distinguish between the short form of a
bibliographic reference and some qualifying or additional information.
The latter should not appear within the scope of the <gi>ref</gi>
element when this is the case, as for example in an application
concerned to normalize bibliographic references:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nelson claims (<ref
target="#NEL80">Nelson [1980]</ref> pages 13–37) ...</egXML>

<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COBIOT"><head>Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes</head>
<p>The bibliographic tagging defined here can capture the distinctions
required by most bibliographic encoding systems; for the benefit of
users of some commonly used systems, the following lists of equivalences
are offered, showing the relationship of the markup defined here to the
fields defined for bibliographic records in the Scribe, BibTeX, and
ProCite systems.
 </p>
<p>Listed below are the equivalences between the various bibliographic fields
defined for use in the Scribe and BibTeX systems of bibliographic
databases and the elements defined in this tag set.<note place="foot">The BibTeX scheme is
intentionally compatible with that of Scribe, although it omits some
fields used by Scribe. Hence only one list of fields is given
here.</note>Elements and structures available in the tag set defined here which

<div2 type="section" xml:id="CODV"><head>Passages of Verse or Drama</head>
<p>The following elements are included in the core tag set for the
convenience of those encoding texts which include mixtures of prose,
verse and drama.
<specList><specDesc key="l" /><specDesc key="lg"/><specDesc key="sp"/><specDesc key="speaker"/><specDesc key="stage" /></specList>
 </p>
<p>Full details of other, more specialized, elements for the encoding of
texts which are predominantly verse or drama are described in the
appropriate chapter of part three (for verse, see the verse base
described in chapter <ptr target="#VE"/>; for performance texts, see the
drama base described in chapter <ptr target="#DR"/>).  In this section, we
describe only the elements listed above, all of which can appear in any
text, whichever of the three modes prose, verse, or drama may predominate
in it.
 </p>
<div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COVE"><head>Core Tags for Verse</head>
<p>Like other written texts, verse texts or poems may be
hierarchically subdivided, for example into books or cantos. These
structural subdivisions should be encoded using the general purpose
<gi>div</gi> or <gi>div1</gi> (etc.) elements described below in
chapters <ptr target="#DS"/> and <ptr target="#VE"/>. The fundamental
unit of a verse text is the verse line rather than the paragraph,
however.</p>
<p>The <gi>l</gi> element is used to mark up verse lines, that is
metrical rather than typographic lines.  Where a metrical line is
interrupted by a typographic line break, the encoder may choose to
ignore the fact entirely or to use the empty <gi>lb</gi> (line break)
element discussed in <ptr target="#CORS"/>.  In the copy text, the
following example is printed on four typographic lines, beginning with
the words <mentioned>There</mentioned>, <mentioned>From</mentioned>, <mentioned>The</mentioned>,
and <mentioned>the</mentioned>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>There they lie, in the largest, in an
open space in the woods,</l>
<l>From 500 to 600 poor fellows &#x2014; the groans
and screams &#x2014;</l>
<l>The odor of blood, mixed with the fresh scent
of the night, <lb/>the grass, the trees &#x2014;
that Slaughter-house!</l></egXML>

	<!-- example from a more important edition, one about whose   -->
	<!-- line breaks one might reasonably care.                   -->
 </p>
<p>Where verse lines are not properly nested within the enclosing
hierarchy (for example where verse lines cross larger boundaries such
as verse paragraphs or speeches) the encoder may choose to use one of
the techniques discussed in chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>, or to use the
<att>part</att> attribute to indicate that the verse line is
incomplete, as in the following example:
<!-- <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>Thou fumblest <name>Eros</name>, and my Queenes a Squire</l>
<l>More tight at this, then thou:  Dispatch. O Loue,</l>

</p>
<p>In some verse forms, regular groupings of lines are regarded as units
of some kind, often identified by a regular verse scheme.  In stichic
verse and couplets, groups of lines analogous to paragraphs are often
indicated by indentation.  In other verse forms, lines are grouped into
irregular sequences indicated simply by white space.  The neutral
<gi>lg</gi> or line group element may be used to mark any such grouping
of lines; the <att>type</att> is available to further categorize the
line group where this is felt desirable, as in the following example.
This example also demonstrates the <att>rend</att> attribute to indicate
whether or not a line is indented.
<!-- rhyme is only enabled if you have the verse base   -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg>
   <l>Come fill up the Glass,</l>
   <l rend="indent">Round, round let it pass,</l>

</lg></egXML>
<!-- from Gay's Beggars Opera -->
 </p>
<p>For some kinds of analysis, it may be useful to identify different
kinds of line group within the same piece of verse. Such line groups
may self-nest, in much the same way as the un-numbered <gi>div</gi>
element described in chapter <ptr target="#DS"/>. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg type="poem.sonnet">
  <lg type="octet">

 </p>
<p>The <att>part</att> attribute may also be attached to an <gi>lg</gi>
element to indicate that it is incomplete, for example because it forms
part of a group that is divided between two speakers, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp>

   <lg type="stanza" part="I">

<p>The <gi>sp</gi> and <gi>stage</gi> elements should also be used to
mark parts of a text otherwise in prose which are presented as if they
were dialogue in a play.  The following example is taken  from a 19th century
   novel in which passages of narrative and passages of dialogue are
   mixed within the same chapter:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp><speaker>The reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>
   <p>I do not think I have named a single unpresentable fish.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Mr Gryll</speaker>
   <p>Bream, Doctor: there is not much to be said for bream.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>The Reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>
   <p>On the contrary, sir, I think there is much to be said for him.  
     In the first place ...</p>
   <p>Fish, Miss Gryll &#x2014; I could discourse to you on fish by the
     hour: but for the present I will forbear ...</p>
</sp></egXML>
<!-- Peacock, Gryll Grange, p 778 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp>
   <speaker>Lord Curryfin</speaker>

   <p><q>Mass</q> as the second grave-digger says
     in <title>Hamlet</title>, <q>I cannot tell.</q></p>

<p>A chorus of laughter dissolved the sitting.</p></egXML>
