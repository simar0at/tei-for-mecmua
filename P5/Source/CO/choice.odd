  <exemplum>
    <p>An American encoding of <title>Gulliver's Travels</title> which
    retains the British spelling but also provides a version
    regularized to American spelling might be encoded as follows.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
   articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of

  <remarks>
    <p>Because the children of a  <gi>choice</gi> element all
    represent alternative ways of encoding the same sequence, it is
    natural to think of them as mutually exclusive. However, there may
    be cases where a full representation of a text requires the
    alternative encodings to be considered as parallel. </p>
<p>Note also that <gi>choice</gi> elements may self-nest.</p>
    <p>For a specialized version of <gi>choice</gi> for encoding multiple
    witnesses of a single source, see section <ptr target="#TCAPLL"/>.</p>
