    <p>The following example treats the short numbered clauses of
Anglo-Saxon legal codes as lists of items.  The text is from an
ordinance of King Athelstan (924&#x2013;939):</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 type="section"><head>Athelstan's Ordinance</head><list type="ordered"><item n="1">Concerning thieves.  First, that no thief is to be
     spared who is caught with the stolen goods, [if he is] over
     twelve years and [if the value of the goods is] over eightpence.
    <list type="ordered"><item n="1.1">And if anyone does spare one, he is to pay for the
      thief with his wergild &#x2014; and the thief is to be no nearer a
      settlement on that account &#x2014; or to clear himself by an oath of
      that amount.</item><item n="1.2">If, however, he [the thief] wishes to defend himself
      or to escape, he is not to be spared [whether younger or older
      than twelve].</item><item n="1.3">If a thief is put into prison, he is to be in prison
      40 days, and he may then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the
      kindred are to stand surety for him that he will desist for ever.</item><item n="1.4">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him
      with his wergild, or to bring him back there.</item><item n="1.5">And if he steals after that, they are to pay
      for him with his wergild, whether to the king or to him
      to whom it rightly belongs; and everyone of those who
      supported  him is to pay 120 shillings to  the king as a fine.</item></list></item><item n="2">Concerning lordless men.  And we pronounced about these
   lordless men, from whom no justice can be obtained, that one
   should order their kindred to fetch back such a person to justice
   and to find him a lord in public meeting.
   <list type="ordered"><item n="2.1">And if they then will not, or cannot, produce him on
      that appointed day, he is then to be a fugitive afterwards, and
      he who encounters him is to strike him down as a thief.</item><item n="2.2">And he who harbours him after that, is to pay for him
      with his wergild or to clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item></list></item><item n="3">Concerning the refusal of justice.  The lord who
    refuses justice and upholds his guilty man, so that the king is
    appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and 120 shillings
    to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands
    justice as often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the
    other would have done, if he had refused him justice.
    <list type="ordered"><item n="3.1">And the lord who is an accessory to a theft by his
      slave, and it becomes known about him, is to forfeit the slave
      and be liable to his wergild on the first occasionp if he does it
      more often, he is to be liable to pay all that he owns.</item><item n="3.2">And likewise any of the king's treasurers or of our
      reeves, who has been an accessory of thieves who have committed
      theft, is to liable to the same.</item></list></item><item n="4">Concerning treachery to a lord.  And we have pronounced
   concerning treachery to a lord, that he [who is accused] is to
   forfeit his life if he cannot deny it or is afterwards convicted
   at the three-fold ordeal.</item></list></div1></egXML>
<p>Note that nested lists have been used so the tagging mirrors the
structure indicated by the two-level numbering of the clauses.
The clauses could have been treated as a one-level list with
irregular numbering, if desired.</p>
