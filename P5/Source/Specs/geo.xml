  <remarks>
    <p>All uses of <gi>geo</gi> within a document are required to use
    the same coordinate system, which is that defined by a
    <gi>geoDecl</gi> element supplied in the TEI Header. If no such
    element is supplied, the assumption is that the content of each
    <gi>geo</gi> element will be a pair of numbers to be interpreted
    as latitude followed by longitude according to the World Geodetic
    System.</p>
