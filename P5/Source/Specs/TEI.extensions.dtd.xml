<macroSpec xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" module="tei" n="User Extensions" xml:id="TEIEXTD" type="pe" ident="TEI.extensions.dtd">
<desc>supplies the name of a file containing any local modifications required to the TEI DTDs.</desc>
  <content/>
  <remarks>
<p>The contents of the file indicated by this entity are embedded
    in a  TEI DTD immediately before the DTD fragments (modules)
requested by the user are embedded.  By default,
the entity expands to the empty string; the user can override this
default by declaring the entity in the DTD subset with an appropriate
value. Typically
this will take the form
<?tei winita?><eg><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM 'project.dtd' >]]></eg>
where <ident type="file">project.dtd</ident> is the name of a file
containing additional element or attribute declarations. These
declarations may include references to any of the TEI-defined classes,
datatypes, or macros described in chapter <ptr target="#ST"/>   </p>
<p>This macro is used only by the XML DTD 
customization mechanism defined in TEI P4. The recommended method of
TEI customization at P5, irrespective of schema language, is to define an ODD.</p> </remarks>
