  <remarks>
    <p>Any numeric value that can be represented as a decimal number.</p>
    <p>In addition, the range of values that can be represented in an
    IEEE double precision (i.e., 64-bit) floating point number may be
    represented using scientific notation. Roughly that range is
    ±10⁻³²³ to
    ±10³⁰⁸.</p>
    <p>To represent a number expressed in scientific notation,
    <soCalled>E notation</soCalled>, a variant of
    <soCalled>exponential notation</soCalled>, is used in the
    attribute value. A number is represented in exponential notation
    as a value between 1 and 10 (or -1 and -10) which is multiplied by
    ten raised to some integral power. When reading E notation, the
    letter <mentioned>E</mentioned> is read as <q>times 10 to the
    power</q>.</p>
    <p>That is, the significand (sometimes called the mantissa) is
    written as a decimal number, followed by the letter
    <mentioned>E</mentioned>, followed by an integer exponent. The
    multiplication sign and the base itself
    (<mentioned>10</mentioned>) are implied. Either the significand or
    the exponent (or both) may be a negative number, in which case it
    should be preceded by a minus sign. There should be no whitespace
    separating the significand from the <mentioned>E</mentioned> from
    the exponent. E.g., 3×10⁸ can be expressed as <val>3E8</val>.</p>
    <p>Other examples of scientific notation include:
    <list><item><val>3E10</val> (the speed of light in centimetres per second)</item><item><val>9.12E-31</val> (the mass of an electron in Kg)</item><item><val>4E11</val> (estimated number of stars in our galaxy)</item><item><val>-1.76E11</val> (electron charge to mass quotient in coulombs per Kg)</item></list>
    </p>
    <p>Either <mentioned>e</mentioned> or <mentioned>E</mentioned> may
    be used to separate the significand from the exponent, however
    these Guidelines recommend <mentioned>E</mentioned> be used both
    for consistency with other standards bodies and to avoid confusion
    with the mathematical constant <code>e</code>.</p>
