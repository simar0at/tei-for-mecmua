<desc>supplies the name of a file containing any local modifications
required to the TEI DTDs.</desc>
  <content/>
  <remarks>

<p>The contents of the file indicated by this entity are embedded in a
TEI DTD immediately before any other declaration.  By default, the
entity expands to the empty string; the user can override this default
by declaring the entity in the DTD subset with an appropriate
value. Typically this will take the form <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&lt;!ENTITY %
TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM 'project.ent' &gt;</egXML> where <ident type="file">project.ent</ident> is the name of a file containing
additional entity declarations. These declarations may not reference
any other element or entity within the TEI modules. They are used to
override the default entity declarations provided for the TEI-defined
classes, datatypes, or macros described in chapter <ptr target="#ST"/>.  </p>

<p>This macro is used only by the XML DTD customization mechanism
defined in TEI P4. The recommended method of TEI customization at P5,
irrespective of schema language, is to define an ODD.</p> </remarks>
