  <remarks>
    <p>This element class contains a subset of those elements which
can appear in the unstructured <soCalled>soup</soCalled> with which
paragraph and other elements at the lowest level of crystal structures
are filled:  specifically all the elements which can also occur as
structural elements in their own right.  In prose, this means the
elements in this class can appear both within and between paragraphs.
This class is thus distinct from the purely phrase-level elements which
can appear only within soup, and not on their own; the latter class, in
keeping with this metaphor, is called <soCalled>broth</soCalled>; it
is represented by the class <term>phrase</term>.  Cf. also the
class <term>chunks</term>.</p>
