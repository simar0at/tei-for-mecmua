<remarks><p>For characters of non-ideographic scripts, a name following
    the conventions for Unicode names should be chosen.  For
    ideographic scripts, an <term>Ideographic Description
    Sequence</term> (IDS) as described in Chapter 10.1 of the Unicode Standard is
    recommended where possible. Projects working in similar fields are
    recommended to coordinate and publish their list of
    <gi>glyphName</gi>s to facilitate data exchange.</p></remarks> </elementSpec>
