   <remarks> It is possible to describe
        the content of the notation using elements from the model.labelLike class and it is possible
        to point to an external representation using elements from model.ptrLike. It is possible to
        specify the location of digital objects representing the notated music in other media such
        as images or audio-visual files. The encoder's interpretation of the correspondence between
        the notated music and these digital objects is not encoded explicitly. We recommend the use
        of graphic and binaryObject mainly as a fallback mechanism when the notated music format is
        not displayable by the application using the encoding. The alignment of encoded notated
        music, images carrying the notation, and audio files is a complex matter for which we refer
        the encoder to other formats and specifications such as MPEG-SMR.</remarks>
