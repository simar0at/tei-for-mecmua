      <valDesc>
	A list of one or more characters, represented either by the
	character itself (which, of course, may be represented as an
	XML numeric character reference) or by listing its 4-digit
	hexidecimal Unicode codepoint preceded by <code>U+</code>.
      </valDesc>
      <remarks>
	<p>By far the most common character used for this is U+002D,
	which is next to <q>0</q> on a typical QWERTY keyboard. The
	most appropriate character, however, is U+2010. Many other
	possibilities exist, including:
