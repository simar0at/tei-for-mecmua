  <remarks>
    <p>Both the beginning and ending of the deleted sequence must be
    marked: the beginning by the <gi>delSpan</gi> element, the ending
    by the target of the <att>spanTo</att> attribute.</p>
    <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible, in order
    for the encoder to be able to transcribe it. If it is not legible
    at all, the <gi>delSpan</gi> tag should not be used. Rather, the
    <gi>gap</gi> tag should be employed to signal that text cannot be
    transcribed, with the value of the <att>reason</att> attribute
    giving the cause for the omission from the transcription as
    deletion. If it is not fully legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element
    should be used to signal the areas of text which cannot be read
    with confidence. See further sections <ptr target="#PHOM"/> and,
    for the close association of the <gi>delSpan</gi> tag with the
    <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>, <gi>unclear</gi> and
    <gi>supplied</gi> elements, <ptr target="#PHCOMB"/>.</p>
    <p>The <gi>delSpan</gi> tag should not be used for deletions made
    by editors or encoders. In these cases, either the <gi>corr</gi>
    tag or the <gi>gap</gi> tag should be used.</p>
