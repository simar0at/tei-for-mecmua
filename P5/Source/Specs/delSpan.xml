be marked; the beginning by the <gi>delSpan</gi> element itself, the
end by the <att>to</att> attribute.  The element pointed at by

  <remarks>
    <p>Both the beginning and ending of the deleted sequence
must be marked:  the beginning by the <gi>delSpan</gi> element, the
ending by the target of the <att>to</att> attribute.</p>
    <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible, in order for
the encoder to be able to transcribe it.  If it is not legible at
all, the <gi>delSpan</gi> tag should not be used.  Rather, the
<gi>gap</gi> tag should be employed to signal that text cannot be
transcribed, with the value of the <att>reason</att> attribute giving
the cause for the omission from the transcription as deletion.  If it
is not fully legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element should be used to
signal the areas of text which cannot be read with confidence.  See
further sections <ptr target="#PHOM"/> and, for the close association of
the <gi>delSpan</gi> tag with the <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>,
<gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> elements, <ptr target="#PHCOMB"/>.</p>
    <p>The <gi>delSpan</gi> tag should not be used for deletions made by
editors or encoders.  In these cases, either the <gi>corr</gi> tag or
the <gi>gap</gi> tag should be used.</p>
