  <remarks>
    <p>If both <att>value</att> and <att>dur</att> are specified, the
    values should be interpreted as indicating a span of time by its
    starting time (or date) and duration. These Guidelines do not
    provide a method for expressing a time range by a duration and its
    ending time.</p>
    <p>In providing a <soCalled>regularized</soCalled> form, no claim
    is made that the form in the source text is incorrect; the
    regularized form is simply that chosen as the main form for
    purposes of unifying variant forms under a single heading.
