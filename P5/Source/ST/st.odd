<head>The TEI infrastructure</head>

<p>This chapter describes the infrastructure for the encoding scheme
defined by these Guidelines.  It introduces the conceptual framework
within which the following chapters are to be understood, and
describes the technical means by which that conceptual framework is
implemented.  It assumes some familiarity with XML and XML schemas
(see chapter <ptr target="#SG"/>) but is intended to be accessible to
any user of these Guidelines. </p>

<p>The TEI encoding scheme consists of a number of
<term>modules</term>, each of which declares particular XML elements
and their attributes. Part of an element's declaration includes its
assignment to one or more element <term>classes</term>. Modules, and
their contents, may be combined more less freely to form a
<term>schema</term> appropriate to a particular set of
requirements. It is also possible to add new elements to a schema
which reference existing classes or elements, as it is to remove
existing elements from a schema.
	</p>

<p>In principle, a TEI schema may be constructed using any combination
of modules. However, certain TEI modules are of particular importance,
and should always be included in all but exceptional circumstances:
the module <ident type="module">tei</ident> described in the present
chapter is of this kind because it defines classes, macros, and
datatypes which are used by all other modules. The <ident
type="module">core</ident> module, defined in chapter <ptr
target="#CO"/> contains declarations for elements and attributes which
are likely to be needed in almost any kind of documents, and is
therefore recommended for global use. The <ident
type="module">header</ident> module defined in chapter <ptr
target="#HD"/> provides declarations for metadata elements and
attributes required for TEI conformance, while the <ident
type="module">text-structure</ident> module defined in chapter <ptr
target="#DS"/> declares basic structural elements needed for the
encoding of almost any text-like object. Most schemas will therefore
need to include these four modules, but are free to mix and match them
with others.</p>

<p>The specification for a TEI schema is itself a TEI document, using
elements from the module described in chapter <ptr target="#TD"/>: we
refer to such a document informally as an <term>ODD</term> document,
from the abbreviation <q>One Document Does it all</q>. Stylesheets for
maintaining and processing ODD documents are maintained by the TEI,
and these Guidelines are also maintained as an ODD. An ODD document
can be processed to generate a schema expressed using any of the three
schema languages currently in wide use: the XML DTD language, the ISO
RelaxNG language, or the W3C Schema language. </p>

<p>This chapter begins by briefly characterizing each of the modules
available in the TEI scheme. Section <ptr target="#STIN" type="div2"/>
describes in general terms the method of constructing  a TEI schema
in a specific schema language such as XML DTD language, RelaxNG, or
W3C Schema. </p>

<p>The <term>global attributes</term>, characteristics postulated of
every element  in the encoding scheme, are defined in section 
<ptr target="#STGA" type="div2"/>.</p>

<p>The remainder of the chapter describes the TEI infrastructure
module itself. This module declares several mechanisms used globally in
the TEI encoding scheme.  It may be skipped at a first reading, but a
proper understanding of the topics addressed here is essential for
anyone planning to take full advantage of the TEI customization
techniques described in chapter <ptr target="#MD"/>. </p>

<p>In particular, the infrastructure module provides the following
components of the TEI encoding scheme:
<list>
<item>definition of all <term>datatypes</term> used to constrain the
range of legal values for TEI attributes (section <ptr
target="#DTYPES"/>)</item>
<item>declarations for all 
<term>element classes</term> used to define groups of elements and
their characteristics (section <ptr target="#STEC"/>)</item>
<item>definition of all <term>macros</term> used to express some
commonly used content models (section <ptr target="#STmacros"/>)</item>
</list>
</p><p>The infrastructure module also provides additional declarations which are
needed only for the generation of XML DTD fragments; these are further
described in section <ptr target="#STPE"/>. </p>



<div2 xml:id="STMA"><head>TEI modules</head>

<p>These Guidelines define a large number of elements and attributes
for marking up documents of any kind. Each definition combines a prose
description, provided within a chapter of the Guidelines and in the
reference lists, with a formal declaration, expressed for reference by
means of the ISO schema language RelaxNG. For convenience, each
element is assigned to a single module: the declaration file for each
module thus contains a set of related element declarations, typically
for use in some specific application area, or to support a particular
kind of usage.
 </p>

<p>Corresponding with each module, the TEI provides a <term>schema
fragment</term> in each of three supported schema languages. A TEI
schema is made by combining these fragments, each of which contains
sets of declarations, as further described in section <ptr
target="#STIN"/> below. <note place="foot">In some cases, a single
module generates two fragments, because
of constraints relating to the order of declarations in XML DTDs. The
two sets of declarations are needed at different points in the
creation of a usable DTD.</note>. The following table lists the
modules defined by the current release of the Guidelines.

<div2 xml:id="STIN"><head>Defining a TEI schema</head>

<p>To determine that an XML document is valid (as opposed tobeing
merely well-formed), its structure must be checked against a
schema. For a valid TEI document, this schema must be a conformant TEI
schema, as further defined in chapter <ptr target="#CF"/>.  Local
systems may allow their schema or DTD to be implicit, but for
interchange purposes the schema associated with a document
<emph>must</emph> be made explicit. </p>

<p>As previously noted, the TEI provides an application independent
way of specifying the components of a TEI schema by means of the
<gi>schemaSpec</gi> element defined in chapter <ptr target="#TD"/>
element. A running XML system, such as a validating editor, may use
this specification in several different ways:

<list>
<item>the ODD specification may be automatically processed to generate
a schema document in whichever schema language the editor
supports</item>
<item>for an editor using DTD language, a DTD subset declaration
invoking the DTD fragments corresponding with the schema specification
may be produced, together with XML DTD code for any additional
modifications</item>
<item>for an editor using RelaxNG language, a schema referencing the
appropriate predefined RelaxNG patterns may be produced, together
with any additional definitions required to support
modifications</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The schema fragments produced by the TEI are delivered in a
parameterised form which facilitates the second and third options
listed above. The recommended method of customization is however the
first. For blind interchange of TEI documents, it should be necessary
to supply no more than a complete ODD specification along with the documents.
</p>

<p>The simplest customization of the TEI scheme combines just the
four recommended modules mentioned above. In ODD format, this would
look like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<schemaSpec ident="TEI-minimal" start="TEI">
  <moduleRef key="tei"/>
  <moduleRef key="header"/>
  <moduleRef key="core"/>
  <moduleRef key="structure"/>
</schemaSpec>
</egXML></p>
<p>An ODD processor will generate an appropriate XML DTD, or relaxNG
or W3C schema from this set of declarations, which would then be
associated with the document instance by one of a number of different
mechanisms, as further described in chapter <ptr target="#SG"/><!-- somewhere --> </p>
<p>The same effect might be obtained in a DTD processing environment
by prefixing the document with a <term>DOCTYPE declaration</term> like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
      <!ENTITY % TEI.XML   'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.header 'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.core 'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.structure 'INCLUDE' >
]>]]></egXML>
or, in a RelaxNG environment, by a schema like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
]>]]></egXML>
</p>

<!-- does this belong here? -->
<p>In much of the discussion elsewhere in these Guidelines, it is
generally assumed for clarity of exposition that a text is a unitary
object for which only one module is necessary.  It is not uncommon,
however, for a text to combine different kinds of object, or for an
encoder to wish to enrich their encoding with elements drawn from many
different modules.  Examples include:

<list type="bullets">
<item>when the text is a collection of other texts, which do not all use
the same module:  e.g. an anthology of prose, verse, and drama</item>
<item>when the text contains other smaller, embedded texts:  e.g. a poem
or song included in a prose narrative</item>
<item>when some sections of the text are written in one form, and others
in a different form:  e.g. a novel where some chapters are in prose,
others take the form of dictionary entries, and still others the form of
scenes in a play</item>
<item>when the text moves back and forth among forms not between
sections but within a single section:  e.g. mixed prose-and-verse forms
like many pastorals or like some portions of the Poetic Edda</item></list></p>
<p>The TEI DTD provides the following mechanisms to handle these cases:
<list type="bullets">
<item>a definition of a corpus or collection as a series of
<gi>TEI</gi>
documents, sharing a common TEI header (see chapter <ptr target="#CC"/>)</item>
<item>a definition of composite texts which comprise front matter, a
group or several possibly nested groups of collected texts,
themselves possibly composite (see section <ptr target="#DSGRP"/>)</item>
<item>a notion of <term>embedded text</term>
which allows one text to be embedded within another (that is,
<gi>text</gi> is defined as a component-level element, as described
briefly at the conclusion of section <ptr target="#DSGRP"/>)</item></list></p>
<p>The following element specification for example allows for any mixture of
the low level structural tags defined in the prose, drama and dictionary
 modules:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec ident="TEI-Moby" start="TEI">
  <moduleRef key="tei"/>
  <moduleRef key="header"/>
  <moduleRef key="core"/>
  <moduleRef key="structure"/>
  <moduleRef key="drama"/>
  <moduleRef key="dictionaries"/>
  <!-- Structurally, Moby Dick is not your
       everyday common or garden variety novel ... -->
</schemaSpec></egXML></p>
</div2>

<div2 xml:id="STGA"><head>Global Attributes</head>
<p>The following attributes are defined for every TEI element.<note
place="foot">More exactly, these are the attributes of the attribute
class <ident type="class">att.global</ident>, to which all elements
belong; for further discussion of attribute classes and ways in which
attributes may be inherited and over-ridden, see section <ptr
target="#STECAT"/>.</note> <specList><specDesc key="att.global"
atts="xml:id n xml:lang rend"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Some modules (e.g. those for terminology, linking, and analysis)
define other global attributes; these are documented in the appropriate
chapters of Part III and Part IV.  See also section <ptr target="#STECAT"/>.
 </p>
<p>Any TEI element may be given values for <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>,
<att>xml:lang</att>, <att>rend</att>, or <att>TEIform</att>, simply by
specifying values for these attributes.
The following two examples convey the same information about the text:
that the material transcribed occurs within a <gi>p</gi> element
(paragraph).  They differ only in that the second provides an identifier
for the paragraph, to which other elements (e.g. notes or hypertext
links) can conveniently refer.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>If to do were as easy as to know what were
good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages
princes' palaces.  It is a good divine that follows his own
instructions ...</p></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p xml:id="mv1.2.5">If to do were as easy as to know what were
good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages
princes' palaces.  It is a good divine that follows his own
instructions ...</p></egXML>
<!-- Merchant of Venice, I.ii, speech 5 (Portia)              -->
</p>
  <p>The values of <att>xml:id</att> attributes must be legal
	<ident type="kw">names</ident> with respect to the SGML declaration in
	force. For XML documents this means that an <att>xml:id</att> value
	must begin with a letter (as defined in the World Wide Web
	Consortium's XML Recommendation) or the underscore charcter
	(<q>_</q>), and contain no characters other than letters, digits,
	hyphens, underscores, full
	stops, and certain combining and extension characters.<note place="foot">The colon is also by default a
	valid name character; however, it is reserved for a specific
	purpose in XML (to indicate namespace prefixes), and is not
	therefore generally recommended by these Guidelines, for
	compatability reasons.</note></p>
  <p>In XML names (and thus the values of <att>xml:id</att> in an XML TEI
	document) upper and lower case letters are distinguished, and
	thus <mentioned>partTime</mentioned> and
	<mentioned>parttime</mentioned> are two distinctly different
	names, and could (perhaps unwisely) be used to denote two
	different element types.</p>
  <p>If two elements are given the same identifier,a validating XML parser will
	signal a syntax error. The following example, therefore, is
	<emph>not</emph> valid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&lt;p xml:id="PAGE1"><q>What's it going to be then, eh?</q>&lt;/p>
<p xml:id="PAGE1">There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs,
that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, ... </p></egXML>
<!-- Clockwork Orange, opening -->
</p>
<p>For a discussion of methods of providing unique identifiers for
elements, see section <ptr target="#CORS2"/>.</p>
<p>The <att>n</att> attribute allows identifying information (e.g.
chapter numbers, etc.) to be encoded even if it would not be a legal
<att>xml:id</att> value.  Its value may be any string of characters;
typically it is a number or other similar enumerator or label.  For
example, the numbers given to the items of a numbered list may be
recorded with the <att>n</att> attribute; this would make it possible to
record errors in the numeration of the original, as in this list of
chapters, transcribed from a faulty original in which the number 10 is
used twice, and 11 is omitted:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="ordered">
  <item n="1">About These Guidelines</item>
  <item n="2">A Gentle Introduction to SGML</item>
  <item n="9">Verse</item>
  <item n="10">Drama</item>
  <item n="10">Spoken Materials </item>
  <item n="12">Printed Dictionaries</item>
</list></egXML>
The <att>n</att> attribute may also be used to record non-unique names
associated with elements in a text, possibly together with a unique
identifier as in the following example start-tags:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type='chap' n='One' xml:id='TXT0101'/></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type='stanza' n='xlii'/></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute indicates the language, writing system,
and character set associated with a given element and all its contents.
If it is not specified, the value is inherited from that of the
immediately enclosing element.  As a rule, therefore, it is simplest to
specify the base language of the text on the <gi>TEI</gi> element, and
allow most elements to take the default value for <att>xml:lang</att>; the
language of an element then need be explicitly specified only for
elements in languages other than the base language.
 </p>
<p>The values used for the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute must be
constructed in a particular way, using values from standard lists. See
further <ptr target="#CHSH"/>.</p>
<p>The following two encodings convey the same information about the
language of the text, since in the first the <att>xml:lang</att> attributes
on the <gi>emph</gi> elements specify the same value as that on the
parent <gi>p</gi> element, while in the second they inherit that value
without specifying it.

 </p>
<p>In the following example, by contrast, the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute
on the <gi>term</gi> element must be given if we wish to record the fact
that the technical terms used are Latin rather than English; no
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute is needed on the <gi>q</gi> element, by
contrast, because it is in the same language as its parent.  It is
strongly recommended that all language shifts in the source be
explicitly identified by use of the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute, as
described in chapter <ptr target="#CH"/>.

</p>
<p>As further discussed in section <ptr target="#CHSH"/>, additional
information  about a particular language
may be supplied in the <gi>language</gi> element within the header (see
section <ptr target="#HD41"/>).</p>
<p>The <att>rend</att> attribute is used to give information about the
physical presentation of the text in the source.  In the following
example, it is used to indicate that both the emphasized word and the
proper name are printed in italics:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p> ... Their motives <emph rend="italics">might</emph> be
 pure and pious; but he was equally alarmed by his knowledge
 of the ambitious <name rend="italics">Bohemond</name>, and

	<!-- Shame, shame.                                            -->
If all or most <gi>emph</gi> and <gi>name</gi> elements are rendered in
the text by italics, it will be more convenient to register that fact in
the TEI header once and for all and specify a <att>rend</att> value
only for any elements which deviate from the usual rendition.
 </p>
<p>The contents of the <att>rend</att> attribute are free text.  In any
given project, encoders are advised to settle on a standard vocabulary
with which to describe typographic or manuscript rendition of the text,
and to document their usage of that vocabulary in the <gi>rendition</gi>
element of the TEI header. </p>
</div2>


<div2 xml:id="STOV"><head>The TEI infrastructure module</head>

<p>The TEI infrastructure module is a required component of any TEI
schema. It provides declarations for all datatypes, and for the
attribute classes, model classes, and macros used by other modules in
the TEI scheme. Its components are listed below in alphabetical order:
<!-- only they aren't-->
<moduleSpec xml:id="DSTTEI2"  ident="tei" type="core">
<altIdent type="FPI">TEI Infrastructure</altIdent>
<desc>Declarations for datatypes, classes, and macros available to all
TEI modules</desc>
</moduleSpec>
</p>

<p>The order in which declarations are provided within the
infrastructure module is critical, since several declarations refer to
others, which must therefore precede them. Other constraints on the
order of declarations derive from the way in which the modularity of
the TEI scheme is implemented in different schema languages. The XML
DTD fragment implementing this TEI module make extensive use of
<term>parameter entities</term> and <term>marked sections</term> to
effect a kind of conditional construction; the RelaxNG schema fragment
similarly predeclares a number of patterns with null
(<soCalled>notAllowed</soCalled>) values. These techniques are further
explained in chapter <ptr target="#SG"/>. </p>

<p>Some components of the infrastructure module are automatically
generated by the ODD processor. Most of these are needed only for the XML
DTD implementation; they are noted below with the phrase <soCalled>DTD
only</soCalled>. </p>

<p>The overall structure of the infrastructure module is as follows:
<list>
<item>Initialisation: 
<list>
<item>Declare TEI.XML marked section to permit SGML support (see
further <ptr target="#STXML"/>). DTD only.</item>
<item>Declare naming entities for all elements to permit renaming. DTD
only.</item>
<item>  <specGrpRef target="#DSTOVLE"/>
Embed any user-supplied entity declarations. DTD
only.</item><!-- only it doesnt happen -->
</list></item>
<item>Declare all available datatype macros (see <ptr
target="#DTYPES"/>)</item>
<item>Declare all globally available attribute classes (see <ptr
target="#STECAT"/>)</item>
<item>Declare all globally available model classes (see <ptr
target="#STECCM"/>)</item>
<item>Declare and embed any user-supplied element declarations. DTD
only. <specGrpRef target="#DSTOVLO"/></item>
<item>Declare and embed conditionally each TEI-defined module (see <ptr
target="#STPE"/>) <specGrpRef target="#DSTKEYS"/> DTD only</item>
</list>
</p>
 <!--

 declare TEI.XML marked section
 n.entities
 data.type entities
 att.class.attributes entities
 (x.) model.class entities
 TEI.module-decl entities
 file.module-decl entities
 guarded invocations of TEI.module-decl entities
 other entities (for macros, and for modules)
 guarded invocations of TEI.module entities

-->

</div2>

<div2 xml:id="DTYPES"><head>Datatype macros</head>
<p>The values which attributes may take in a TEI schema are defined,
for the most part, by reference to a TEI <term>datatype</term>. Each
such datatype is defined in terms of other primitive datatypes (for
the most part defined by the W3C Schema language <!-- need proper
reference-->), literal values, or other datatypes. This indirection
makes it possible for a TEI application to set constraints either
globally or in individual cases, by redefining the datatype definition
or the reference to it respectively. In some cases, the TEI datatype
includes additional usage constraints which cannot be enforced by
existing schema languages, although a TEI-compliant processor should
attempt to validate them (see further discussion in chapter <ptr
target="#CF"/>). </p>
<p>Where literal values or name tokens are used in a datatype
definition, an associated value list supplies definitions for the
significance of suggested or (in the case of closed lists) all
possible values.</p>
<!-- but can we put a valList in a macroSpec ? -->
<p>TEI-defined datatypes may be grouped into those which define
normalised values for numeric quantities or probabilities, those which
define various kinds of short-hand codes or keys, and those which
define pointers or links. </p>
<p>The following datatypes are used for attributes which are intended
to hold normalized values of various kinds. First, expressions of quantity:
<specList>
<!-- specDesc key="data.certainty"/ --> <!-- not apparently used -->
<specDesc key="data.probability"/>
<specDesc key="data.numeric"/>
<specDesc key="data.count"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>Examples of attributes using the data.probability datatype include
<att>degree</att> on <gi>damage</gi> or <gi>certainty</gi>;  <att>scale</att> on
<gi>graphic</gi>; examples of  data.numeric include
<att>quantity</att> on  members of the <ident
type="class">att.measurement</ident> class or <att>value</att> on
<gi>numeric</gi>; examples of data.count include <att>cols</att> on
<gi>cell</gi> and <gi>table</gi>.</p>

<p>
They are formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"
	 xml:id="DTYPES-1" n="Numeric Datatypes">
<!-- &data.certainty; -->
&data.probability;
&data.numeric;
&data.count;
</specGrp>
</p>
<p>Next, the datatypes used for attributes which are intended to hold
normalized dates or times, durations, or truth values:
<specList>
<specDesc key="data.duration"/> <!-- only one usage! -->
<specDesc key="data.temporal"/>
<specDesc key="data.truthValue"/>
<specDesc key="data.xTruthValue"/>
<specDesc key="data.language"/>
<specDesc key="data.sex"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>Note that in each of these cases the values used are those
recommended by existing international standards: ISO 8601 in the case
of time, date, and duration; RelaxNG in the case of truth values; RFC
1766 in the case of language; and ISO 5218 in the case of sex.</p>
<p>Examples of attributes using these datatypes include
...They are formally defined as follows:

&data.temporal;
&data.duration;
&data.truthvalue;
&data.xtruthvalue;
&data.language;
&data.sex;
</specGrp>
</p>
<p>The following datatypes have more specialised uses:
<specList>
<specDesc key="data.outputMeasurement"/>
<specDesc key="data.namespace"/>
<specDesc key="data.pattern"/> <!-- only one usage -->
<specDesc key="data.pointer"/>
<specDesc key="data.pointers"/>

	 xml:id="DTYPES-3" n="Notation and pointer datatypes">
&data.namespace;
&data.outputmeasurement;
&data.pattern;
&data.pointer;
&data.pointers;
</specGrp>
</p>
<p>By far the largest number of TEI attributes have values which are
coded values or names of some kind. These values may be constrained or
defined in a number of different ways, each of which is given a
different name, as follows:
<specList>
<specDesc key="data.key"/> <!-- 2 uses -->
<specDesc key="data.word"/>
<specDesc key="data.words"/>
<specDesc key="data.name"/>
<specDesc key="data.names"/>
<specDesc key="data.enumerated"/>
<specDesc key="data.code"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>Attributes such as <att>key</att> of <gi>persName</gi> and other
members of the <ident type="class">att.naming</ident> class are of type
<ident type="datatype">data.key</ident>. They are used to supply an externally-defined
identifier, such as a database key or filename. Because such
identifiers are externally-defined, no constraints are placed on their
possible values: and any string of Unicode characters may be used. If
constraints on their values are known to the encoder such as the rules
for constructing a valid database key in a particular system, this may
be documented within the TEI Header but cannot be enforced.</p>

<p>Attributes of type <ident type="datatype">data.word</ident>, such as
<att>age</att> on <gi>person</gi> are used to supply an identifier
expressed as any kind of single token or word. The TEI places a few
constraints on the characters which may be used for this purpose:
only Unicode characters classified as letters, digits,  punctuation
characters, or symbols can appear in an attribute value of this
kind. Note in particular that such values cannot  cannot include
whitespace name. Legal values include
<val>cholmondeley</val>, <val>été</val>, <val>1234</val>, <val>e_content</val>, or
<val>xml:id</val>, but not  <val>grand
wazoo</val>. Attributes of this kind are sometimes used to associate (by
co-reference) elements of different types.</p>

<p>Attributes of type <ident type="datatype">data.name</ident> are also words in
this sense, but they have the additional constraint that they must be
legal XML identifiers, as defined by the XML 1.0 specification. As
such, they may not begin with digits or punctuation characters. Legal
identifiers include <val>cholmondeley</val>, <val>été</val>,
<val>e_content</val>, or <val>xml:id</val>, but not <val>grand
wazoo</val> or <val>1234</val>. Attributes of this kind are typically used to
represent XML element or attribute names.</p>

<p>Corresponding with these two datatypes, the TEI provides
<soCalled>list</soCalled> valued datatypes <ident type="datatype">data.words</ident>
and <ident type="datatype">data.names</ident>. These may be used to supply a list of
words or names (as defined above), each being separated by a single space. </p>

<p>Attributes of type <ident type="datatype">data.enumerated</ident>, such as
<att>zone</att> on <gi>time</gi> have the same definition as
<ident type="datatype">data.word</ident> above, with the added semantics that the word
supplied is taken from a specific list of possibilities. In each case,
the element or class specification which includes the definition for
the attribute will also contain a list of possible values, together
with a prose description of their intended significance. This list may
be open (in which case the list is advisory), or closed (in which
case, it determines the range of legal values).</p>

<p>Attributes of type <ident type="datatype">data.code</ident> such as <att>new</att>
and <att>old</att> on <gi>handShift</gi> are similar in function, in
that they also supply encoded names for values which are defined in
more detail elsewhere. In this case, however, the full definition is
supplied as content of another XML element, typically but not
necessarily in the same document, and it is referenced by means of a
pointer. </p>

<p>Here are the specifications for these datatypes:
<specGrp xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"

<div2 xml:id="STEC"><head>The TEI Class System</head>

<p>The TEI scheme distinguishes over four hundred different elements.
To aid comprehension, modularity, and modification, the majority of
these elements are formally classified in some way.  Classes are used
to express two distinct kinds of commonality among elements.  The
elements of a class may share some set of attributes, or they may
appear in the same locations in a content model.  A class is known as
an <term>attribute class</term> if its members share attributes, and
as an <term>model class</term> if its members appear at the same
locations in the content models of other TEI elements. In either case,
an element is said to <term>inherit</term> attributes, or the ability
to appear at a given point in a document, from any classes of which it
is a member.  Classes may have subclasses and superclasses, and the
characteristics of a superclass are inherited by all members of its
subclasses.
 </p>

<p>In the RelaxNG fragments which express the TEI scheme, attribute
and model classes are represented by patterns whose names begin with
<ident>att.</ident> or <ident>model.</ident> respectively. The same
names are used in the XML DTD fragments for the parameter entities
used to implement the class system.
 </p>

<p>In both cases, the <ident type="module">tei</ident> module provides
an appropriate initial declaration for the class, so that it can
subsequently be referenced, either by a subclass, or by someone
wishing to extend the class with a new element. </p>

<p>This section describes the major element classes of each type.
 </p>

<div3 xml:id="STECAT"><head>Attribute Classes</head>

<p>An attribute class groups together elements which share some set of
common attributes.  Attribute classes are given names beginning
<code>att.</code> and are usually adjectival. For example, the members
of the class <ident type="class">att.naming</ident> are all elements
which contain proper nouns: e.g.  <gi>name</gi>, <gi>placeName</gi>,
or <gi>persName</gi>.  These elements also have in common a <att>key</att>
attribute, which may be used to record information about the
referent of the proper nouns.  This attribute is said to be defined by
(or inherited from) the <ident type="class">att.naming</ident> class. If
another new element (say <soCalled>animalName</soCalled>) were to be
added to the TEI scheme for which a similar  <att>key</att> attribute was
considered useful, the simplest way to add it would be to make the new
element a member of the <ident type="class">att.naming</ident>
class. </p>

<p>The attributes provided by an attribute class are generally only
those specified by the class itself. However, one attribute class may
itself inherit attributes from another. For example, the attribute
class <ident type="class">att.pointing.group</ident> provides
attributes <att>domains</att> and <att>targFunc</att> to all of its
members. This class is however a subclass of the <ident
type="class">att.pointing</ident> class, from which its members also
inherit the attributes <att>type</att> and <att>evaluate</att>.
Members of the class <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident> will
thus have these two attributes, while members of the class <ident
type="class">att.pointing.group</ident> will have all four.</p>

<p>Most attribute classes are defined within the present module and
are thus globally available. Some classes are specific to particular
modules and thus defined in other chapters. A globally defined class
may however be a subclass of a module-specific class; in such a case,
the attributes defined by the module-specific class are available only
when the module concerned is included in a schema. For example, the
attribute class <ident type="class">att.divLike</ident> makes
attributes <att>org</att>, <att>uniform</att>, and <att>sample</att>
available to any member of that class. It also declares itself a
subclass of the <ident type="class">att.metrical</ident> class, which
additionally provides attributes <att>met</att>, <att>real</att>, and
<att>rhyme</att>. However, <ident type="class">att.metrical</ident>
class is only defined when the <ident type="module">verse</ident>
module is included in a schema; if it is not, <ident
type="class">att.divLike</ident> elements only gain the three
attributes first mentioned. </p>

<p>The following lists all declared attribute classes:

<p>In XML DTD fragments, the attributes shared by the members of an
attribute class are defined by a parameter entity; member elements
inherit the attributes by referring to this parameter entity within
their attribute-list declaration (examples below).  This practice
helps ensure that if the attribute definitions for the class change,
all members of the class will automatically inherit the new
definitions.  The parameter entities used for this purpose form their
names by taking the name of the class they define (including the
<code>att.</code> prefix) and suffixing the string
<mentioned>attributes</mentioned>.  For example, the declaration for
the <ident type="class">att.naming</ident> class includes attribute
definitions for its two attributes <att>reg</att> and <att>key</att>:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % att.naming.attributes '
      key  CDATA #IMPLIED
      reg  CDATA #IMPLIED'> 
]]></egXML> 
Members of the class typically inherit these definitions by referring to
<ident type="class">att.naming.attributes</ident>:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % name 'INCLUDE' >
<!ELEMENT %n.name; %om.RR;  %phrase.seq;> 
<!ATTLIST %n.name;
      %att.global.attributes;
      %att.naming.attributes;
      type CDATA #IMPLIED  >
]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Subclasses of attribute classes inherit the attributes of their superclass
similarly, by referring to the  entity of the superclass in
their own definition.  </p>

<!-- and in relaxng? -->

</div3>
<div3 xml:id="STECCM"><head>Model Classes</head>

<p>When the members of a class are structurally similar and can appear
at the same kinds of structural locations in the document, they are
said to grouped together into an m-class (or
<soCalled>model-class</soCalled>). Like a-classes, m-classes may have
subclasses or superclasses.  Just as elements inherit from a class the
ability to appear in certain locations of a document (wherever the
class can appear), so all members of a subclass inherit the ability to
appear wherever any superclass can appear. </p>

<p>Model classes are implemented by
defining a parameter entity for use in the formal declaration of element
content models.  The parameter entity takes the name of the class it
defines, and prefixes the string <mentioned>m.</mentioned>, which can be
interpreted as <gloss>model</gloss> or as <gloss>members</gloss>.  The
replacement text of the entity is a list of the members of the class,
separated by <mentioned>|</mentioned>, the content model symbol for alternation.</p>

<p>For each class an additional entity is defined, which also takes
the name of the class, this time prefixed by the string
<mentioned>x.</mentioned> (for extension); the default value of these
<term>x-dot entities</term> is always an empty string.  A reference to
the corresponding x-dot entity is always included within the
replacement string for each m-dot entity.  This enables an encoder to
add new members to a class simply by declaring a new value for an
x-dot entity.
 </p>
<p>For example, the class <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident> has the three
members <gi>bibl</gi>, <gi>biblFull</gi>, and <gi>biblStruct</gi>.
Its content-model entity is defined thus:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % x.bibl '' >
<!ENTITY % model.biblLike '%x.bibl; bibl | biblFull | biblStruct' >]]></egXML>
With the default value of the x-dot entity, this is the same as defining
<ident type="pe">model.biblLike</ident> with the replacement text <code>bibl | biblFull | biblStruct</code>.  If an encoder wishes
to add a new bibliographic element called <gi>my.bib</gi>, it can
be added to the <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident> class by redefining the
x-dot entity thus:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % x.bibl 'my.bib |' >]]></egXML>
This changes the replacement text of <ident type="pe">model.biblLike</ident> from
its default value to <code>my.bib | bibl | biblFull |
biblStruct</code>.  If more than one element is to be added to a class,
the x-dot entity for the class should be redefined as a list of the new
generic identifiers, each one <emph>(including the last)</emph> followed
by a vertical bar.  The same effect could be achieved simply by
redefining the whole of the new <ident type="pe">model.biblLike</ident> entity
directly, but the x-dot method requires no repetition of the already
existing members of the class and thus minimizes the chance of error.
 </p>
<p> Superclasses transmit their location characteristics to their
subclasses by referring, in declaring their m-dot entity, to the m-dot
entities of the subclasses.
 </p>
<p>For example, the class <ident type="class">model.phrase</ident> includes the
classes <ident type="class">model.pPart.data</ident>, <ident type="class">model.pPart.edit</ident>,
<ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident>, <ident type="class">model.ptrLike</ident>, and
<ident type="class">model.segLike</ident> as members, as can be seen in the
declaration for its m-dot entity:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % class.phrase "%x.class.phrase; %class.data; | %class.edit;
 | %class.formPointers; | %class.hqphrase; | %class.loc; 
 | %class.oddPhr; | %class.phrase.verse; | %class.seg; | %n.formula; 
 | %n.handShift;">]]></egXML>
 When the entity <ident type="pe">model.phrase</ident> is referred to in
content models, all members of all subclasses are included in the model.
 </p></div3>


<div3 xml:id="STECOV"><head>High-level structural element classes</head>

<p>The TEI class system is structured around the following threefold
division of elements:
<list type="gloss"><label><term>chunks</term> </label>
<item>elements such as paragraphs and other
paragraph-level elements, which can appear directly within texts or
within text subdivisions (i.e. <gi>div</gi> elements), but not within
other chunks</item><label><term>phrase-level elements</term> </label>
<item>elements such as
highlighted phrases, book titles, or editorial corrections which can
occur only within chunks (paragraphs or paragraph-level elements), but
not between them (and thus cannot appear directly within a
<gi>div</gi>)<note place="foot">Note that in this context, <term>phrase</term> means
any string of characters, and can apply to individual words, parts of
words, and groups of words indifferently; it does not refer only to
linguistically motivated phrasal units.  This may cause confusion for
readers accustomed to applying the word in a more restrictive sense.</note></item>
<label><term>inter-level elements</term></label>
<item>elements such as lists,
notes, quotations, etc. which can appear either between chunks (as
children of a <gi>div</gi>) or within them</item></list>
 </p>
<p>Together the two sets of <term>chunks</term> and <term>inter-level
elements</term> make up the set of:
<list type="gloss"><label><term>text components</term> </label>
<item>elements which can appear
directly within texts or text divisions; also called simply
<term>components</term> or <soCalled>component-level elements</soCalled></item></list>
In general, the body of any text comprises a series of components,
optionally grouped into <gi>div</gi> elements.
 </p>
<p>Some elements belong to none of these classes; these include
high-level structural elements like <gi>TEI</gi> and
<gi>group</gi> as well as some specialized elements which appear only
within particular structures (like <gi>analytic</gi>,
<gi>monographic</gi>, and <gi>series</gi>).  The majority of elements
found in normal running text, however, are assigned  to
one or the other of these classes.

<p>Some <term>macro.component</term> elements (e.g. <gi>p</gi> or
<gi>note</gi>) are common to all base modules, while others are unique
to individual modules.

These three classes together make up the <ident type="class">model.global</ident>

<div3 xml:id="STECHI"><head>High-Level Element Classes</head>
<p>The following element classes are used to implement the threefold
structural distinction among phrases, chunks, and intermediate elements
discussed above in section <ptr target="#STECOV"/>.  In this terminology,
<term>chunk</term>s (or <term>chunk elements</term>) are elements which
can occur only in chunk-level sequences (e.g. between but not within
paragraphs); <term>inter-level elements</term> can occur either within
chunks (at phrase-level) or between chunks (e.g. at paragraph-level),
and <term>phrase-level elements</term> can occur only at phrase level,
within chunks (e.g. within but not between paragraphs).
 </p>
<p>The element class <ident type="class">model.common</ident> includes all
component-level (chunk- and inter-level) elements common to more than
one base.  It is used in implementing the combined bases described in
section <ptr target="#STECMX"/>.

<div3 xml:id="STECMK"><head>Elements Marked for Text Type</head>
<p>The following element classes are used to group together

<div2 xml:id="STPE"><head>Other Parameter Entities in TEI DTDs</head>

<p>The TEI DTDs use parameter entities for several purposes:
<list type="bullets">
<item>to define sets of attributes shared by given classes of elements</item>
<item>to define classes of elements which can occur at the same
locations in content models</item>
<item>to identify what base module should be used for a document</item>
<item>to identify what additional modules should be included</item>
<item>to include or exclude the declaration of each element</item>
<item>to specify the name of each element</item>
<item>to specify tag omissibility information within
a DTD, or alternatively to omit such information in an XML DTD</item>
</list>
The first two applications of parameter entities are described above in
section <ptr target="#STEC"/>.  This chapter describes the other uses of
parameter entities in the TEI DTDs.
 </p>
<p>Special purpose parameter entities are used to specify which
modules are to be used in a combined into a TEI DTD. They take the
form <val>TEI.xxxxx</val> where <code>xxxx</code> is the name of the
module as given in the table above (<ptr target="#STMA"/>): for
example, the
parameter entity <ident type="pe">TEI.linking</ident> is used to
define whether or not to include the module <ident
type="module">linking</ident>. All such parameter entities are
declared by default with the value <val>IGNORE</val>:  to select a
module, therefore, the encoder declares the appropriate parameter entities with the
value <val>INCLUDE</val>. <!-- Note that the three basic modules
(<ident>tei</ident>, <ident>header</ident>, and <ident>core</ident>)
are already included in the TEI main DTD, and therefore do not need to
be included in this way. --><!-- not any more they're not -->
</p>
<p>Any local modifications (i.e. changes to a schema other than
simple inclusion or exclusion of modules) are 
made by declarations stored in one of two local extension
files. Entity declarations must be made associating the names of these
two files with the appropriate parameter entity so that the
declarations they contain can be embedded within the TEI DTD at the
appropriate point.</p>

<p>The following entities are referred to by the main
<ident type="file">tei2.dtd</ident> file to embed portions of the TEI DTDs
or locally developed extensions.
<list type="gloss"><label><ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident></label>
<item>identifies a local file containing
extensions to the TEI parameter entities; see section <ptr target="#STOVLO"/></item><label><ident type="pe">extensions</ident></label>
<item>identifies a local file containing
extensions to the TEI module; see section <ptr target="#STOVLO"/></item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.elementNames</ident></label>
<item>identifies a file containing parameter
entity declarations for names of TEI elements; see section <ptr target="#STPEGI"/></item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.keywords</ident></label>
<item>identifies a file containing parameter
entity declarations for TEI keywords, including the default
declaration (<val>IGNORE</val>) of the marked-section keyword for
each module; see section <ptr target="#STPEKW"/></item><label><ident type="pe">teiclasses</ident> </label>
<item>identifies a file
containing definitions of parameter entities used in content models; see
section <ptr target="#STECOV"/></item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.singleBase.1</ident> </label>
<item>defined as
<val>INCLUDE</val>
(for normal bases) or <val>IGNORE</val> (for mixed and general base);
used to prevent multiple definitions of the default text
structure.</item>
<label>TEI.XML</label>
<item>indicates whether the target DTD is to be expressed in SGML or
XML. By default, this parameter entity has the value <val>INCLUDE</val>; the
user should therefore declare it with the <val>IGNORE</val> in order
to use  an SGML DTD; see
<ptr target="#STXML"/>.</item>
</list>
 </p>

<div3 xml:id="STPEEX"><head>Inclusion and Exclusion of Elements</head>

<p>The TEI DTDs use marked sections and parameter entity references to
allow users to exclude the definitions of individual elements, in order
either to make the elements illegal in a document or to allow the
element to be redefined, as further described in chapter <ptr target="#MD"/>.</p>
<p>Parameter entities used for this purpose have exactly the same name
as the generic identifier of the element concerned.  The default
definition for these parameter entities is <val>INCLUDE</val> but they may
be changed to <val>IGNORE</val> in order to exclude the standard element and
attribute definition list declarations from the DTD.
 </p>

<p>The declarations for the element <gi>p</gi>, for example, are
preceded by a definition for a parameter entity with the name
<ident rend="noindex" type="ge">p</ident> and contained within a marked
section whose keyword is
given as <code>%p;</code>:
<eg><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % p 'INCLUDE' >
<![ %p; [
       <!-- element and attlist declaration for p here -->
]]]]></eg></p><p>These parameter entities are defined immediately preceding the
element whose declarations they control; because their names are
completely regular, they are not documented further.
 </p></div3>

<div3 xml:id="STPEGI"><head>Parameter Entities for Element Generic Identifiers</head>

<p>In the TEI DTD fragments, elements are not referred to directly by their
generic identifiers; instead, the DTDs refer to parameter entities which
expand to the standard generic identifiers.
This allows users to rename elements by redefining the appropriate
parameter entity (as described more fully in chapter <ptr target="#MD"/>).
Parameter entities used for this purpose are formed
by taking the standard generic identifier of the element and
attaching the string <q>n.</q> as a prefix.  Thus the standard generic
identifiers for paragraphs, notes, and quotations, <gi>p</gi>,
<gi>note</gi>, and <gi>q</gi> are defined by declarations of the
following form:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % n.p "p">
<!ENTITY % n.pb "pb">
<!ENTITY % n.persName "persName">]]></egXML>
</p>
<p>Since all names in the TEI DTD are case-sensitive, the specific
mix of upper and lower case letters in the standard generic identifier must be
preserved in the entity name.
 </p></div3>

<!--<div3 xml:id="STPEKW"><head>Parameter Entities for TEI Keywords</head>
 <p>The TEI uses the following parameter entities to signal
information which cannot be expressed using attribute declaration keywords:
<list type="gloss"><label>INHERITED </label>
<item>indicates that an attribute value is inherited
from the enclosing element, if not specified</item><label>ISO-date </label>
<item>indicates that the
attribute value should be a date in a format defined by ISO
8601:2000(E), usually yyyy-mm-dd (e.g. 1993-06-28).</item><label>regexp</label>
<item>indicates that an attribute value should be a regular expression
as defined in <title>XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second
Edition</title>, <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#regexs">Appendix
F</ref></item></list>
In addition, the parameter entities which control the selection of
base and additional modules may be regarded as a keyword.
</p>
<p>The parameter entity <ident type="pe">INHERITED</ident> is used
to signal that the default value for an attribute should be inherited
from an enclosing element.
The definition for <ident type="pe">INHERITED</ident> is
the string <q>#IMPLIED</q>; as for all implied defaults, the application
program is responsible for deducing the default attribute value when no
value is specified in the element start-tag.  Since the parameter entity
is resolved by the parser, the application program will see no
difference between attributes whose default is <q>%INHERITED;</q> and
those whose default is <q>#IMPLIED</q> &#x2014; information about which
attribute values are inherited and which are inferred in some other way
must be built into the application in advance.
 </p>
<p>The parameter entity <ident type="pe">ISO-date</ident> is used to
signal that
the value for an attribute should be an ISO-standard date value; in
this notation,<note place="foot">Defined by ISO 8601:2000(E),
<title>Data elements and interchange formats &#x2014; Information
interchange &#x2014;  Representation of dates and times</title>
([Geneva]:  International Organization for Standardization, 2000).</note>
a date like <q>September 22, 1968</q> would be written
<q>1968-09-22</q> (or alternatively as <q>19680922</q>, <q>1968-W38-7</q>, <q>1968W387</q>, <q>1968-266</q>, or <q>1968266</q>).
The parameter entity <ident type="pe">ISO-date</ident>
expands to <q>CDATA</q>.

 </p>
</div3>
-->

<div3 xml:id="STOVLO"><head>Embedding Local Modifications</head>
<p>As noted above in section <ptr target="#STPE"/>, local modifications
to the DTD are most conveniently grouped into two files, one containing
modifications to the TEI parameter entities, and the other new or
changed declarations of elements and their attributes.  These files
should be associated with the parameter entities
<ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident> and
<ident type="pe">extensions</ident> by declarations included in
the document's DTD subset.</p>
<p>For example, if the relevant files are called <ident rend="noindex" type="file">project.ent</ident> and <ident rend="noindex" type="file">project.dtd</ident>, then declarations like the following
would be appropriate:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % extensions-decl SYSTEM 'project.ent' >
<!ENTITY % extensions SYSTEM 'project.dtd' >]]></egXML></p>
<p>When an entity is declared more than once, the first declaration
is binding and the others are ignored.  The local modifications to
parameter entities should therefore be handled before the standard
parameter entities themselves are declared in <ident type="file">tei2.dtd</ident>.  The entity <ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident> is referred to before any TEI
declarations are handled, to allow the user's declarations to take
priority.  If the user does not provide a <ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident> entity, the entity will be expanded
to the empty string.</p>
<p>For example the encoder might wish to add two phrase-level elements
<gi>it</gi> and <gi>bd</gi>, perhaps as synonyms for
<tag>hi rend='italics'</tag> and <tag>hi rend='bold'</tag>.  As
described in chapter <ptr target="#MD"/>, this involves two distinct steps:
one to define the new elements, and the other to ensure that they are
placed into the TEI document structure at the right place.  We deal with
the second first, by specifying the element class to which the new
elements should be attached.  To do this, the standard parameter entity
<ident type="pe">x.phrase</ident> should be modified to include the two
new generic identifiers.  The file containing local declarations of the
standard parameter entities will thus contain a declaration of the
following form:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % x.phrase 'it | bd |' >]]></egXML></p>


<p>The relevant fragment of the DTD is this:<specGrp xml:id="DSTOVLE" n="Local modifications to parameter entities">
&teiexte.odd;
</specGrp>
</p>
</div3>
<div3 xml:id="STXML"><head>Generation of Schemas and DTDs </head>
<p>The TEI Guidelines can
generate schemas, or DTDs which are both SGML and XML compliant.</p>
<p>Only two SGML tag omissibility indicators are used in the TEI
Guidelines: <code>- O</code> (i.e., the end-tag may be omitted but not
the start-tag); and <code>- -</code> (i.e. neither start- nor end-tag
may be omitted). Two parameter entities are defined, one called
<ident type="pe">om.RO</ident> (<q>omissibility-required-optional</q>), and the
other called <ident type="pe">om.RR</ident>
(<q>omissibility-required-required</q>). In SGML mode, the value for each of these
parameter entities is the appropriate indicator. Content models in the
text of the Guidelines and in generated DTDs always reference the
omissibility information by means of one or the other of these
parameter entities. </p>
<p>In  XML mode (the default) tags are never omissible and omissibility
indicators are syntactically invalid. Thus 
these parameter entities are redefined as the null string, by
means of a second set of declarations contained within the file
<ident type="file">keywords.ent</ident> and controlled by a marked section
guarded by the <ident type="pe">TEI.XML</ident> parameter entity. 
If the user declares a parameter
entity TEI.XML with the value INCLUDE in the DTD subset, then the 
parameter entities representing tag omissibility indicators will
be redefined as null strings, so that the resulting DTD is XML
conformant;
if the parameter entity is set to IGNORE, the DTD is suitable for SGML.</p>

<!--
Each module is contained in one or more system files, which are
defined by appropriate inclusions of  schema modules or 
<term>parameter entity declarations</term>
and invoked as a unit by
<term>parameter entity references</term> in a DTD.<note place="foot">A <term>parameter entity</term> is an entity used only in
markup declarations; references to parameter entities are delimited by a
percent sign and a semicolon rather than the ampersand and colon used
for <term>general entity</term> references.  The entity <ident type="pe">TEI.core.ent</ident>, for example, would be referred to using
the string <code>%TEI.core.ent;</code>.  Parameter entities can also be
used to control the inclusion or exclusion of <term>marked
sections</term> of the document or DTD; the TEI DTD uses marked
sections to handle the selection of different base and additional tag
sets.</note>
Several such declarations may be needed to invoke all parts of a given
module, since as well as defining elements or attributes, a module may
(for example) add new items to the set of global attributes or add
classes to the system of element classes.  Consistent naming principles
are applied throughout the TEI scheme for these and other entities.
Thus, assuming a module named <ident rend="noindex" type="class">tei.xxx</ident>, the following parameter entities may be
encountered:
<list type="gloss"><label>TEI.xxx </label>
<item>used to enable or disable module <ident type="module" rend="noindex">xxx</ident>; must have the value <val>INCLUDE</val> (module is enabled) or, by default, <val>IGNORE</val> (module not enabled).
 </item><label>TEI.xxx.ent </label>
<item>refers to a system file containing any
parameter entity declarations unique to module <ident rend="noindex" type="class">tei.xxx</ident>.
 </item><label>TEI.xxx.dtd </label>
<item>refers to a system file containing the element
and attribute list declarations for module <ident rend="noindex" type="class">tei.xxx</ident>.
 </item><label>a.xxx </label>
<item>contains definitions of attributes which are to be
added to the set of global attributes when module <ident rend="noindex" type="class">tei.xxx</ident> is enabled.
 </item><label>m.comp.xxx </label>
<item>a list of any component-level elements
unique to base module <ident rend="noindex" type="class">tei.xxx</ident>
(for a definition of component-level elements, see section <ptr target="#STEC"/>).
 </item><label>mix.xxx </label>
<item>a special entity for use in defining the set of
component-level elements when the mixed base module is in use.
 </item><label>gen.xxx </label>
<item>a special entity for use in defining the set of
component-level elements when the general base module is in use.
 </item></list>
Few modules declare all of these entities; only those actually used are
declared.
 </p>
<p>The interpretation of the parameter entity declarations, and the
inclusion of the appropriate modules, are handled by a single
<soCalled>driver file</soCalled> for the main TEI DTD.  This file,
<ident type="file">tei2.dtd</ident>, is described in detail below in
section <ptr target="#STOV"/>.  The remainder of the present section
identifies the files in which each module is contained, and the
parameter entities associated with them.
 </p>
<div3 xml:id="STBACO"><head>The Core Modules</head>
<p>Two <soCalled>core</soCalled> modules are always included in every
invocation of the main TEI DTD.  The tags and attributes that they
contain are therefore available to any TEI document.  The parameter
entities used for this purpose, and the files they refer to, are:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident type="pe">core</ident> </label>
<item>refers to the file
<ident type="file">core.dtd</ident>, which declares the core tags
defined in chapter <ptr target="#CO"/>
 </item><label><ident type="pe">header</ident> </label>
<item>refers to the file
<ident type="file">header.dtd</ident>, which declares the tags of the TEI
header defined in chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>
 </item></list>
Together with these modules, part II also documents a module for
default text structure and front and back matter.  This module is
embedded by the base module selected, and may vary with the base; it is
therefore described in the next section.
 </p></div3>
<div3 xml:id="STBABA"><head>The Base Modules</head>
<p>The base modules are those which define the basic building blocks of
different text types.  The basic structures of verse (line, stanza,
canto, etc.), for example, are not those of prose (paragraph, section,
chapter, etc.), while dictionaries use yet another set of basic
structures.  Each base corresponds to one chapter of Part III of this
document.
 </p>
<p>In general, exactly one base module must be selected for any
TEI-conformant document.  Errors will result if none, or more than one,
is selected, because the same elements may be differently defined in
different base modules.  For documents which mingle structurally
dissimilar elements and require elements from more than one base,
however, either the <term>mixed base</term> or the <term>general
base</term> may be used; see section <ptr target="#STCO"/>.
These bases require the encoder to specify which of the other bases are
to be combined.
</p>
<p>The encoder selects a base module by declaring the appropriate
parameter entity with the replacement text <val>INCLUDE</val>
To invoke the base module for prose, for example, the encoder must
ensure that the DTD subset in the document contains the declaration:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY % TEI.prose 'INCLUDE' >]]></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The entities used to select the different base modules, and the
files containing the declarations for each base, are listed below.
<list type="gloss"><label><ident type="pe">TEI.prose</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base module
for prose, contained in <ident type="file">prose.dtd</ident>.
  </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.verse</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base module
for verse, contained in <ident type="file">verse.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">verse.ent</ident>.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.drama</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base module
for drama, contained in <ident type="file">drama.dtd</ident> and <ident type="file">drama.ent</ident>.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.spoken</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base module
for transcriptions of spoken texts, contained in
<ident type="file">spoken.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">spoken.ent</ident>.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.dictionaries</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base
module for print dictionaries, contained in
<ident type="file">dictionaries.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">dictionaries.ent</ident>.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.terminology</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base tag
set for terminological data files, contained in
<ident type="file">terminology.dtd</ident>,
<ident type="file">terminology.ent</ident>,
<ident type="file">teite2n.dtd</ident>, and
<ident type="file">termflat.ent</ident>.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.general</ident> </label>
<item>selects the generic
mixed-mode base base module, contained in
<ident type="file">general.dtd</ident>.
  </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.mixed</ident> </label>
<item>selects the base module
for free mixed-mode texts, contained in
<ident type="file">mixed.dtd</ident>.
  </item></list>
 </p>
<p>As shown in the list, each base module is normally contained in one
or two system files:  a required one (with the extension
<mentioned>dtd</mentioned>) defining the elements in the module and their
attributes, and an optional one (with the file extension
<mentioned>ent</mentioned>) defining any global attributes or specialized
element classes enabled by that module.  The parameter entities for
these files have the same name as the enabling parameter entity for the
base, with the suffixes <mentioned>ent</mentioned> and <mentioned>dtd</mentioned>
respectively:  the verse base, for example, is enabled by declaring the
parameter entity <ident type="pe">TEI.verse</ident> as <val>INCLUDE</val>; this in turn enables declarations of <ident type="pe">verse-decl</ident> and <ident type="pe">verse</ident>
as the system files <ident type="file">verse.ent</ident> and
<ident type="file">verse.dtd</ident>.  For further details, see
section <ptr target="#STOV"/>. </p>
<p>Most base modules (but not necessarily all) embed common definitions
of text structure, front matter, and back matter, by referring to three
standard parameter entities; these are:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident type="pe">structure</ident> </label>
<item>refers to the file
<ident type="file">structure.dtd</ident>, with default definitions for
<gi>text</gi>, <gi>div</gi>, etc.
 </item><label><ident type="pe">front</ident> </label>
<item>refers to the file
<ident type="file">frontmatter.dtd</ident>, with tags for front matter
 </item><label><ident type="pe">back</ident> </label>
<item>refers to the file
<ident type="file">backmatter.dtd</ident>, with tags for back matter
 </item></list>
These default-structure tags are documented in chapter <ptr target="#DS"/>.
 </p></div3>
<div3 xml:id="STBAAD"><head>The Additional Modules</head>
<p>The additional modules define optional tags required by different
encoders for different types of analysis and processing; each
corresponds to a chapter in part IV of this document.  In any TEI
encoding, any or all of these additional modules may be made available,
as they are all compatible with each other and with every base module.
They are invoked in the same way as base modules, by defining the
appropriate parameter entity as <val>INCLUDE</val>; the
relevant parameter entities, and the files containing the additional tag
sets, are these:

<list type="gloss">
<label><ident type="pe">TEI.msdescription</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">msdesc.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">msdesc.ent</ident>, used for the detailed
description of manuscript or early print materials (chapter <ptr target="#MS"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.linking</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">linking.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">linking.ent</ident>, with tags for linking,
segmentation, and alignment (chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>)
 </item>
<label><ident type="pe">TEI.analysis</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">analysis.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">analysis.ent</ident>,
with tags for simple analytic mechanisms (chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.fs</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the file
<ident type="file">iso-fs.dtd</ident>,
with tags for feature structure analysis (chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.certainty</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the file
<ident type="file">certainty2.dtd</ident>,
with tags for indicating uncertainty and
probability in the markup (chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.transcr</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">transcr.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">transcr.ent</ident>,
with tags for manuscripts, analytic bibliography, and transcription of
primary sources (chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.textcrit</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">teitc2.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">teitc2.ent</ident>,
with tags for critical editions (chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.names.dates</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">namesdates.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">namesdates.ent</ident>,
with specialized tags for names and dates (chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>)
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.nets</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the file <ident type="file">nets.dtd</ident>, with tags for graphs, digraphs, trees,
and other networks (chapter <ptr target="#GD"/>) &#x2014; not to be confused
with the graphics markup of <ident type="pe">TEI.figures</ident>
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.figures</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the files
<ident type="file">figures.dtd</ident> and
<ident type="file">figures.ent</ident>,
with tags for graphics, figures,
illustrations, tables, and formulae (chapter <ptr target="#FT"/>) &#x2014; not
to be confused with the graph-theoretic markup of <ident type="pe">TEI.nets</ident>
 </item><label><ident type="pe">TEI.corpus</ident> </label>
<item>embeds the file <ident type="file">corpus.dtd</ident>, with tags for additional tags for
language corpora (chapter <ptr target="#CC"/>)
 </item></list>
 </p>
<p>Like the base modules, the additional modules are each contained in
one or two system files:  a required one (with the file extension
<mentioned>dtd</mentioned>) defining the elements in the module and their
attributes, and an optional one (with the file extension
<mentioned>ent</mentioned>) defining any global attributes or specialized
element classes enabled by that module.  The parameter entities for
these files have the same name as the enabling parameter entity for the
module, with the suffixes <mentioned>ent</mentioned> and <mentioned>dtd</mentioned>
respectively:  the additional module for linking, segmentation, and
alignment, for example, is enabled by declaring the parameter entity
<ident type="pe">TEI.linking</ident> as <val>INCLUDE</val>;
this in turn
enables declarations of <ident type="pe">linking-decl</ident> and
<ident type="pe">linking</ident> as the system files
<ident type="file">linking.ent</ident> and
<ident type="file">linking.dtd</ident>.
 </p></div3>
<div3 xml:id="STBAUS"><head>User-Defined Modules</head>
<p>As described in chapter <ptr target="#MD"/>, users may modify the markup
language defined here by renaming elements, suppressing elements, adding
new elements, or modifying element or attribute-list declarations.  In
general, local modifications will be most conveniently grouped into two
files:  one containing the local modifications to parameter entities
used in the DTDs, and the other containing new or modified
declarations of elements and their attributes.  These files will be
embedded in the TEI DTD if they are associated with the following two
parameter entities:
<list type="gloss"><label><ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident></label>
<item>local modifications to parameter entities</item><label><ident type="pe">extensions</ident></label>
<item>declarations of new elements and modified
declarations for existing elements</item></list>
 </p>
<p>In some cases, users may wish to provide completely new base or
additional modules, to be invoked in the same way as those defined in
this document; such modules should also be divided into
<soCalled>entity files</soCalled> and <soCalled>DTD files</soCalled> in
the same way as the standard modules.  Such modifications should be
undertaken only with a thorough understanding of the interface among
core, base, and additional modules as documented in the final sections
of this chapter; see in particular section <ptr target="#STOVLO"/>.
 </p>
<p>Further recommendations for the creation of user-defined extension or
modification are provided in chapters <ptr target="#MD"/> and <ptr target="#CF"/>.
</p> 	</div3></div2>	-->
<!--<p>The same effect might also be obtained by An equivalent schema might be defined for use with an XML aware
editor by  TEI DTD file as
an external file, and specifies a single base module for use in the
document, using the parameter entity names specified in section <ptr target="#STBA"/>.  For example, a document using the base module for
prose will begin with a document type declaration something like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
      <!ENTITY % TEI.XML   'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.prose 'INCLUDE' >
]>]]></egXML>
A document using the base module for drama will define a different
parameter entity:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
      <!ENTITY % TEI.XML   'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.drama 'INCLUDE' >
]>]]></egXML></p>
<p>If one or more of the <term>additional modules</term> described in
Part IV are to be used, they are invoked in the same way as the base tag
set.  A document using the base module for prose, with the additional
modules for text criticism and for linking, segmentation, and
alignment, for example, will begin with a document type declaration
something like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
      <!ENTITY % TEI.XML      'INCLUDE' >

      <!ENTITY % TEI.prose 'INCLUDE' >

      <!ENTITY % TEI.textcrit 'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.linking 'INCLUDE' >
 ]>]]></egXML></p>
<p>If local modifications are used, they may be stored in separate
files and pointed to using the parameter entities <ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident> and <ident type="pe">extensions</ident>.  If such local modifications are
added to the example just given, this is the result:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
      <!ENTITY % TEI.XML      'INCLUDE' >

      <!ENTITY % extensions-decl SYSTEM 'project.ent' >
      <!ENTITY % extensions SYSTEM 'project.dtd' >

      <!ENTITY % TEI.prose 'INCLUDE' >

      <!ENTITY % TEI.textcrit 'INCLUDE' >
      <!ENTITY % TEI.linking 'INCLUDE' >
 ]>]]></egXML>
<p>If the document requires tags which are defined in different base
modules (e.g. prose and drama) or embeds smaller texts which use
different base modules, then one of the mixed-type bases must be used.
Their proper invocation is described below in section <ptr target="#STCO"/>.</p></div2>
