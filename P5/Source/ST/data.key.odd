  <remarks>
    <p>Information about the set of possible values for an attribute using this datatype
    may (but need not) be documented in the document
    header. Externally defined
    constraints, for example that values should be legal keys in an
    external database system, cannot usually be enforced by a TEI
    system. Similarly, because the key is externally defined, no constraint
    other than a requirement that it consist of Unicode characters is
    possible. </p>
