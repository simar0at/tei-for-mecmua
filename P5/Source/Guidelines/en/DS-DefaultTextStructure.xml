<head>Default Text Structure</head>
<p>This chapter describes the default high-level structure for TEI
documents. A full TEI document combines metadata describing
it, represented by a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, with the document
itself, represented by a <gi>text</gi> element. This basic pair is
represented by a <gi>TEI</gi> element. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> element
is specified by the <ident>header</ident> module, which is fully
described in chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>. The remainder of the present
chapter describes the <gi>text</gi> element and its high-level
constituents. </p>

<p>A variant on this basic form, the <gi>teiCorpus</gi>, is also
defined for the representation of language corpora, or other
collections of encoded texts. A <gi>teiCorpus</gi> consists of one or
more complete <gi>TEI</gi> elements, each combining a
<gi>teiHeader</gi> and a <gi>text</gi>, which itself carries a
<gi>teiHeader</gi>. This permits the encoder to distinguish metadata
applicable to the whole collection of encoded texts, which is
represented by the outermost <gi>teiHeader</gi>, from that applicable
to each of the individual <gi>TEI</gi> elements within the
corpus. Further information about the organization and encoding of
language corpora is given in chapter <ptr target="#CC"/>. </p>

<p>In summary, the following elements are available for the
representation of the outermost structure of a TEI document:
<specList>
<specDesc key="TEI"/>
<specDesc key="teiCorpus"/>
<specDesc key="teiHeader"/>
</specList>
As noted above, the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element is formally declared in
the <ident type="module">header</ident> module (see chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>). The <gi>TEI</gi> and <gi>teiCorpus</gi>
elements are formally declared as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DCOTOPELEMENTS" >
&TEI;
&teiCorpus;
</specGrp>
</p>


<p>TEI texts may be regarded either as <term>unitary</term>, that is,
forming an organic whole, or as <term>composite,</term> that is,
consisting of several components which are in some important sense
independent of each other.  The distinction is not always entirely
obvious:  for example a collection of essays might be regarded as a
single item in some circumstances, or as a number of distinct items in
others.  In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to
treat the text as unitary or composite; each may have advantages and
disadvantages in a given situation.
 </p>

<p>Whether unitary or composite, the text is marked with the
<gi>text</gi> tag and may contain front matter, a text body, and back
matter.  In unitary texts, the text body is tagged <gi>body</gi>; in
composite texts, where the text body consists of a series of subordinate
texts or groups, it is tagged <gi>group</gi>.  The overall structure of
any text, unitary or composite, is thus defined by the following
elements:
<specList><specDesc key="text"/><specDesc key="front"/><specDesc key="body"/><specDesc key="group"/><specDesc key="back"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The overall structure of a unitary text is:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI>
  <teiHeader> <!-- .... --> </teiHeader>
  <text>
    <front>
<!-- front matter of copy text, if any, goes here -->
    </front>
    <body>
<!-- body of copy text goes here -->
    </body>
    <back>
<!-- back matter of copy text, if any, goes here -->
    </back>
  </text>
 </TEI></egXML></p>
<p>The overall structure of a composite text made up of two unitary
texts is:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI>
  <teiHeader>   <!-- .... --> </teiHeader>
  <text>
    <front>
<!-- front matter for composite text -->
    </front>
    <group>
      <text>
        <front>
<!-- front matter of first unitary text, if any -->
        </front>
        <body>
<!-- body of first unitary text -->
        </body>
        <back>
<!-- back matter of first unitary text, if any -->
        </back>
      </text>
      <text>
        <body>
<!-- body of second unitary text -->
        </body>
      </text>
    </group>
    <back>
<!-- back matter for composite text, if any -->
    </back>
  </text>
 </TEI></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Finally, a <gi>floatingText</gi> element is provided for the case
where one text is contained by another, but does not contribute to
its hierarchical organization, for example because it is quoted or
embedded within it. This is useful in such common literary contexts as
the <q>play within a play</q> or the narrative interrupted by (often
deeply nested) multiple narratives. </p>
<p>Each of these elements is further described in the following
subsections. The elements <gi>text</gi>, <gi>body</gi>,
<gi>group</gi>, and <gi>floatingText</gi> are
formally declared as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSTEXT" >
<!--n="Top-level parts of default structure"-->
&text;
&body;
&group;
&floatingText;
</specGrp>
Elements <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> are declared separately, and
are further discussed in sections <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/> and <ptr
target="#DSBACK"/>. The <gi>group</gi>
and <gi>floatingText</gi> elements, used for more complex or composite
text structures, are further discussed in section
<ptr target="#DSGRPF"/>. Other textual elements, such as paragraphs, lists
or phrases, which nest within these major structural elements, are
discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CO"/>, in the case of elements
which can appear in any kind of document, or elsewhere in the case of
elements specific to particular kinds of document. 
</p>
<div type="div2" xml:id="DSDIV"><head>Divisions of the Body</head>

<p>In some texts, the body consists simply of a sequence of low-level
structural items, referred to here as <term>components</term> or
<term>component-level elements</term> (see section <ptr
target="#STEC"/>).  Examples in prose texts include paragraphs or
lists; in dramatic texts, speeches and stage directions; in
dictionaries, dictionary entries.  In other cases sequences of such
elements will be grouped together hierarchically into textual
divisions and subdivisions, such as chapters or sections.  The names
used for these structural subdivisions of texts vary with the genre
and period of the text, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or
publisher. For example, a major subdivision of an epic or of the Bible
is generally called a <soCalled>book</soCalled>, that of a report is
usually called a <soCalled>part</soCalled> or
<soCalled>section</soCalled>, that of a novel a
<soCalled>chapter</soCalled> â€” unless it is an epistolary novel, in
which case it may be called a <soCalled>letter</soCalled>.  Even texts
which are not organized as linear prose narratives, or not as
narratives at all, will frequently be subdivided in a similar way: a
drama into <soCalled>acts</soCalled> and <soCalled>scenes</soCalled>;
a reference book into <soCalled>sections</soCalled>; a diary or day
book into <soCalled>entries</soCalled>; a newspaper into
<soCalled>issues</soCalled> and <soCalled>sections</soCalled>, and so
forth.
 </p>

<p>Because of this variety, these Guidelines propose that all such
textual divisions be regarded as occurrences of the same neutrally named
elements, with an attribute <att>type</att> used to categorize elements
independently of their hierarchic level.  Two alternative styles are
provided for the marking of these neutral divisions:
<term>numbered</term> and <term>un-numbered</term>.  Numbered divisions
are named  <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>, etc., where the
number indicates the depth of this particular division within the
hierarchy, the largest such division being <q>div1</q>, any subdivision
within it being <q>div2</q>, any further sub-sub-division being
<q>div3</q> and so on.  Un-numbered divisions are simply named
<gi>div</gi>, and allowed to nest recursively to indicate their
hierarchic depth.  The two styles must <emph>not</emph> be combined
within a single <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi> or <gi>back</gi> element.
 </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSDIV1"><head>Un-numbered Divisions</head>
<p>The following element is used to identify textual subdivisions
in the un-numbered style:
<specList><specDesc key="div"/></specList>
As a member of the class <ident type="class">att.divLike</ident>, this element has the
following additional attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.divLike" atts="type"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Using this style, the body of a text containing two parts, each
composed of two chapters, might be represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body>
  <div type="part" n="1">
    <div type="chapter" n="1">
      <!-- text of part 1, chapter 1 -->
 </div>
    <div type="chapter" n="2">
      <!-- text of part 1, chapter 2 -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <div type="part" n="2">
    <div n="1" type="chapter">
      <!-- text of part 2, chapter 1 -->
    </div>
    <div n="2" type="chapter">
      <!-- text of part 2, chapter 2 -->
    </div>
  </div>
</body></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>div</gi> element has the following formal definition:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSDIV">
<!-- n="Un-numbered divisions"-->
&div;
</specGrp>
</p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSDIV2"><head>Numbered Divisions</head>
<p>The following elements are used to identify textual subdivisions
in the numbered style:
<specList>
<specDesc key="div1"/>
<specDesc key="div2"/>
<specDesc key="div3"/>
<specDesc key="div4"/>
<specDesc key="div5"/>
<specDesc key="div6"/>
<specDesc key="div7"/>
</specList>
As members of the class <ident type="class">att.divLike</ident> these elements all bear the
following additional attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.divLike" atts="type"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The largest possible subdivision of the body is
<gi>div1</gi> element and the smallest possible <gi>div7</gi>.
If numbered divisions are in use, a division at any one level (say,
<gi>div3</gi>), may contain only numbered divisions at the next lowest
level (in this case, <gi>div4</gi>).</p>
<p>Using this style, the body of a text containing two parts, each
composed of two chapters, might be represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body>
  <div1 type="part" n="1">
    <div2 type="chapter" n="1">
      <!-- text of part 1, chapter 1 -->
 </div2>
    <div2 type="chapter" n="2">
      <!-- text of part 1, chapter 2 -->
    </div2>
  </div1>
  <div1 type="part" n="2">
    <div2 n="1" type="chapter">
      <!-- text of part 2, chapter 1 -->
    </div2>
    <div2 n="2" type="chapter">
      <!-- text of part 2, chapter 2 -->
    </div2>
  </div1>
</body></egXML>

<!-- Changed example:  the point of the div1/div0             -->
	<!-- alternation in the body is to allow the scheme to        -->
	<!-- handle Chapters at a consistent level with or without    -->
	<!-- surrounding Parts, so the natural way to tag Part and    -->
	<!-- Chapter here is div0 div1, not div1 div2, or at least    -->
	<!-- so it seems to me.  -msm                                 -->
	<!-- tough if you then want sections too (LB) -->
	<!-- Also changed to agree with previous example in N values  -->
	<!-- and comments. -msm                                       -->
 </p>
<p>Formal definitions for these elements are as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSDIVN" >
<!--n="Numbered divisions"-->
&div1;
&div2;
&div3;
&div4;
&div5;
&div6;
&div7;
</specGrp>
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSDIV3"><head>Numbered or Un-numbered?</head>
<p>Within the same <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, or <gi>back</gi>
element, all hierarchic subdivisions must be marked using
either nested <gi>div</gi> elements, or <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi> etc.
elements nested as appropriate; the two
styles must <emph>not</emph> be mixed.
</p>
<p>The choice between numbered and un-numbered divisions will depend
to some extent on the complexity of the material: un-numbered
divisions allow for an arbitrary depth of nesting, while numbered
divisions limit the depth of the tree which can be constructed.  Where
divisions at different levels should be processed differently (for
example to ensure that chapters, but not sections begin on a new
page), numbered divisions slightly simplify the task of defining the
desired processing for each level, though this distinction could also
be made by supplying this information on the <att>type</att> attribute
of an un-numbered <gi>div</gi>.  Some software may find numbered
divisions easier to process, as there is no need to maintain knowledge
of the whole document structure in order to know the level at which a
division occurs; such software may however find it difficult to cope
with some other aspects of the TEI scheme.  On the other hand, in a
collection of many works it may prove difficult or impossible to
ensure that the same numbered division always corresponds with the
same type of textual feature: a <soCalled>chapter</soCalled> may be at
level 1 in one work and level 3 in another. 
 </p>
<p>Whichever style is used, the global <att>n</att> and <att>xml:id</att>
attributes (section <ptr target="#STGA"/>) may be used to provide
reference strings or labels for each division of a text, where
appropriate. Such labels should be provided for each section
which is regarded as significant for referencing purposes (on
reference systems, see further section <ptr target="#CORS"/>).  
</p>
<p>As indicated above, the <att>type</att> attribute is used to
provide a name or description for the division.  Typical values might
be <soCalled>book</soCalled>, <soCalled>chapter</soCalled>, <soCalled>section</soCalled>, <soCalled>part</soCalled>, or (for
verse texts) <soCalled>book</soCalled>, <soCalled>canto</soCalled>, <soCalled>stanza</soCalled>, or (for
dramatic texts) <soCalled>act</soCalled>, <soCalled>scene</soCalled>.  
<!--note place="foot">In previous versions of these Guidelines this
attribute had a declared value of <val>#CURRENT</val>, which in SGML
implies that if defaulted, the value used will be that most recently
specified on any element of the same kind, scanning the text left to
right.  Hence, if un-numbered divisions are used, the appropriate
value must be specified each time a change of level occurs, both
<soCalled>down</soCalled> and <soCalled>up</soCalled> the document
hierarchy. In any case, this value is not available in XML, and so the
present edition of these Guidelines does not use it.</note--></p>

<!-- could add something about use of divNlike class to rename
elements?  LB -->

<p>The following extended example uses numbered divisions to indicate
the structure of a novel, and illustrates the use of the attributes
discussed above.  It also uses some elements discussed in section <ptr target="#DSDTB"/>
and the <gi>p</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#COPA"/>.

 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSDIV3X"><head>Partial and Composite Divisions</head>
<p>In most situations, the textual subdivisions marked by <gi>div</gi>
elements will be both complete and identically organized with
reference to the original source.  For some purposes however, in
particular where dealing with unusually large or unusually small
texts, encoders may find it convenient to present as textual divisions
sequences of text which are incomplete with reference to the original
text, or which are in fact an ad hoc agglomeration of tiny texts.
Moreover, in some kinds of texts it is difficult or impossible to
determine the order in which individual subdivisions should be
combined to form the next higher level of subdivision, as noted
below.
 </p>
<p>To overcome these problems, the following additional attributes are
defined for all elements in the <ident type="class">att.divLike</ident> class:
<specList><specDesc key="att.divLike" atts="org sample part"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>For example, an encoder might choose to transcribe only the first two
thousand words of each chapter from a novel.  In such a case, each
chapter might conveniently be regarded as a partial division, and tagged
with a <gi>div</gi> element in the following form:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div n="xx" sample="initial" part="Y" type="chapter">
  <p> ... </p>
</div></egXML>
where <q>xx</q> represents a number for the chapter.  The <gi>gap</gi>
element (<ptr target="#COEDADD"/>) may be used to indicate exactly
where material has been omitted: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div n="xx" part="Y" type="chapter">
  <p> ... </p>
  <gap extent="2" reason="sampling"/>
  <p> ... </p>
</div></egXML>
The
<gi>samplingDecl</gi> element in the TEI Header should also be used to
record the principles underlying the selection of incomplete samples, as
further described in section <ptr target="#HD52"/>.
 </p>
<p>The following example demonstrates how a newspaper column composed of
very short unrelated snippets may be encoded using these attributes:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 type="storylist" org="composite">
<head>News in brief</head>
<div2 type="story">
<head>Police deny <soCalled>losing</soCalled> bomb</head>
<p>Scotland Yard yesterday denied claims in the Sunday
Express that anti-terrorist officers trailing an IRA van
loaded with explosives in north London had lost track of
it 10 days ago.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="story">
<head>Hotel blaze</head>
<p>Nearly 200 guests were evacuated before dawn
yesterday after fire broke out at the Scandic
Crown hotel in the Royal Mile, Edinburgh.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="story">
<head>Test match split</head>
<p>Test Match Special next summer will be split
between Radio 5 and Radio 3, after protests this
year that it disrupted Radio 3's music schedule.</p>
</div2>
</div1></egXML> 
<!-- Guardian 21 Dec 1992, p 2 -->
</p>
<p>The <att>org</att> attribute on the <gi>div1</gi> element is used
here to indicate that individual stories in this group, marked here as
<gi>div2</gi>, are really quite independent of each other, although they
are all marked as subdivisions of the whole group.  They can be read in
any order without affecting the sense of the piece; indeed, in some
cases, divisions of this nature are printed in such a way as to make it
impossible to determine the order in which they are intended to be read.
Individual stories can be added or removed without affecting the
existing components.
 </p>
<p>This method of encoding composite texts as composite divisions has
some limitations compared with the more general and powerful mechanisms
discussed in section <ptr target="#DSGRP"/>. However, it may be preferable
in some circumstances, notably where the individual texts are very
small.
 </p></div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="DSDTB"><head>Elements Common to All Divisions</head>
<p>The divisions of any kind of text may sometimes begin with a brief
heading or descriptive title, with or without a byline, an epigraph or
brief quotation, or a salutation such as one finds at the start of a
letter.  They may also conclude with a brief trailer, byline, or
signature. Elements which may appear in this way, either at the start
or at the end of a text division proper, are regarded as forming a
class, known as <term>model.divWrapper</term>; a further class, known
as <term>model.divWrapper.bottom</term> defines similar elements which
can appear only at the end of divisions.
 </p>
<p>The following special-purpose elements are provided to
mark features which may appear only at the start of a division:
<specList>
<specDesc key="head" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="epigraph"/>
<specDesc key="argument"/>
<specDesc key="opener"/>
</specList>
For further details of the <gi>head</gi> element, see section <ptr target="#DSHD"/>; 
for <gi>epigraph</gi> and <gi>argument</gi>, see section
<ptr target="#DSAE"/>; for <gi>opener</gi>, see section <ptr target="#DSOC"/>.
 </p>
<p>The following special-purpose elements are provided to mark features
which may appear only at the end of a division:
<specList>
<specDesc key="trailer"/>
<specDesc key="closer"/>
</specList>
For further details of the <gi>trailer</gi> element, see section <ptr target="#DSHD"/>; 
for the <gi>closer</gi> element, section <ptr target="#DSOC"/>.
</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSHD"><head>Headings and Trailers</head>
<p>The <gi>head</gi> element is used to identify a heading prefixed to
the start of any textual division, at any level. A given division may
of course contain more than one such element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 n="Etym">
<head>Etymology</head>
<head>(Supplied by a late consumptive usher to a
grammar school)</head>
<p>The pale Usher â€” threadbare in coat, heart,
body and brain; I see him now. He was ever
dusting his old lexicons and grammars, ...</p></div1></egXML>
<!-- H Melville, M.Dick -->
 </p>
<p>Unlike some other markup schemes, the TEI scheme does
<emph>not</emph> require that headings attached to textual subdivisions
at different hierarchic levels have different identifiers. All kinds of
heading are marked identically using the <gi>head</gi> tag; the type or
level of heading intended is implied by the immediate parent of the
<gi>head</gi> element, which may for example be a <gi>div1</gi>,
<gi>div2</gi>, etc., an un-numbered <gi>div</gi>, or a <gi>list</gi>.
 </p>
<p>In certain kinds of text (notably newspapers), there may be a need
to categorize individual headings within the sequence at the start of a
division,  for example as <soCalled>main</soCalled> headings, or <soCalled>detail</soCalled>
headings. Specific elements are provided for certain kinds of
heading-like features, (notably <gi>byline</gi>, <gi>dateline</gi>, and
<gi>salute</gi>; see further section <ptr target="#DSOC"/>),  but the
<att>type</att> attribute must be used to discriminate among other
forms of heading.
 </p>
<p>In the following example, taken from a British newspaper, the lead
story and its associated headlines have been encoded  as a <gi>div</gi>
element, with appropriate <term>divtop</term> elements attached:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="story">
<head rend="large underlined" type="sub">
President pledges safeguards for 2,400 British
troops in Bosnia</head>
<head rend="very large bold" type="main">
Major agrees to enforced no-fly zone</head>
<byline>By George Jones, Political Editor, in Washington</byline>
<p>Greater Western intervention in the conflict in
former Yugoslavia was pledged by President Bush ...</p></div></egXML>
<!-- Daily Telegraph 21 Dec 1992 -->
 </p>
<p>In older writings, the headings or <term>incipits</term> may be
longer than in modern works.
When heading-like material appears in the middle of a text, the encoder
must decide whether or not to treat it as the start of a new division.
If the phrase in question appears to be more closely connected with what
follows than with what precedes it, then it may be regarded as a
heading and tagged as the <gi>head</gi> of a new <gi>div</gi> element.
If it appears to be simply inserted or superimposed â€” as for example
the kind of <soCalled>pull quotes</soCalled> often found in newspapers
or magazines, then the <gi>quote</gi>, <gi>q</gi>, or <gi>cit</gi>
element may be more appropriate.
 </p>
<p>The <gi>trailer</gi> element, which can appear at the end of a
division only, is used to mark any heading-like feature appearing in
this position, as in this example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="book" n="I"><head>In the name of Christ here begins the
    first book of the ecclesiastical history of Georgius Florentinus,
    known as Gregory, Bishop of Tours.</head>

<p>In addition to headings of various kinds, divisions sometimes include
more or less formulaic opening or closing passages, typically conveying
such information as the name and address of the person to whom the
division is addressed, the place or time of its production, a salutation
or exhortation to the reader, and so on.  Divisions in epistolary form
are particularly liable to include such features.  
Additional elements for the detailed encoding of personal names, dates,
and places are provided in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>.
For simple cases, the following elements should be adequate:
<specList>
<specDesc key="byline"/>
<specDesc key="dateline"/>
<specDesc key="salute"/>
<specDesc key="signed"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>byline</gi> and <gi>dateline</gi> elements are used to encode
headings which identify the authorship and provenance of a division.
Although the terminology derives from newspaper usage, there is no
implication that <gi>dateline</gi> or <gi>byline</gi> elements apply
only to newspaper texts.  The following example illustrates use of the
<gi>dateline</gi> and <gi>signed</gi> elements at the end of the
preface to a novel:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="preface">
<head>To Henry Hope.</head>
<p>It is not because this volume was conceived and partly
executed amid the glades and galleries of the Deepdene,
that I have inscribed it with your name. ... I shall find a
reflex to their efforts in your own generous spirit and
enlightened mind.

<p>Where a sequence of such elements appear together, either at the
beginning or end of an element, it may be convenient to group them
together using one of the following elements:
<specList><specDesc key="opener"/>
<specDesc key="closer"/>
</specList>
The following examples demonstrate the use of the <gi>opener</gi> and

<div type="div3" xml:id="DSAE"><head>Arguments and Epigraphs</head>
<p>The <gi>argument</gi> element may be used to encode the prefatory
list of topics sometimes found at the start of a chapter or
other division.  It is most conveniently encoded as a list, since this
allows each item to be distinguished, but may also simply be presented
as a paragraph.  The following are thus both equally valid ways of
encoding the same argument:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chap" n="6">

      â€” Instructive observations on carved oak and life in general

 </p>
<p>An <term>epigraph</term> is a quotation from some other work
appearing on a title page, or at the start of a division.  It may be
encoded using the special-purpose <gi>epigraph</gi> element.  Its
content will generally be a <gi>q</gi> or <gi>quote</gi> element,
often associated with a bibliographic reference, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div n="19" type="chap"><head>Chapter 19</head>
 <epigraph>
 <cit><quote>I pity the man who can travel
     from Dan to Beersheba, and say <q>'Tis all

<p>For discussion of quotations appearing other than as epigraphs refer
to section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>.
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSCO"><head>Content of Textual Divisions</head>
<p>Other than elements from the <term>model.divWrapper</term> or
<term>model.divWrapper.bottom</term> classes, every
textual division (numbered or un-numbered) consists of a sequence of
ungrouped <term>macro.component</term> elements (see <ptr target="#STEC"/>).  
The actual elements available will depend on the 
modules in use; in all cases, at least the component-level structural
elements defined in the core will be available (paragraphs, lists,
dramatic speeches, verse lines and line groups etc.).  If the drama
module has been selected, then additionally the low level dramatic
structural elements (speeches or stage directions, as defined in
chapter <ptr target="#DR"/>) will be available.  If the dictionary module
is in use, then dictionary entries, related entries, etc. (as defined
in chapter <ptr target="#DI"/>) will also be available; if the module
for transcribed speech is in use, then utterances, pauses, vocals,
kinesics, etc., as defined in chapter <ptr target="#TSBA"/> will be
available; and so on.
 </p>
<p>Where a text contains low level elements from more than one
module these may appear at any point; there is no requirement that
elements from the same module be kept together.
 </p>
<p>The elements discussed in this section are formally defined as
follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSDIVX">
<!-- n="Tags for start and end of divisions"-->
&trailer;
&byline;
&dateline;
&argument;
&epigraph;

</specGrp>
</p>
</div> 
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="DSGRPF"><head>Grouped and Floating Texts</head>
<p>The <gi>group</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#DSGRP"/>
should be used to represent a collection of independent texts which is
to be regarded as a single unit for processing or other purposes.  The
<gi>floatingText</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#DSFLT"/>
should be used to represent an independent text which interrupts the
text containing it at any point but after which the surrounding text
resumes.  <specList><specDesc key="group"/><specDesc
key="floatingText"/></specList>
</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DSGRP"><head>Grouped Texts</head>
<p>
Examples of composite texts which should be represented using the
<gi>group</gi> element include
anthologies and other collections. The presence of common front matter
referring to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter
relating to each individual text, is a good indication that a given text
might usefully be encoded in this way; this structure may be found
useful in other circumstances too.
 </p>
<p>For example, the overall structure of a collection of
short stories might be encoded as follows:

</p>
<p>A text which is a member of a group may itself contain groups. This
is quite common in collections of verse, but may happen in any kind of
text. As an example, consider the overall structure of a typical
collection, such as the <title>Muses Library</title> edition of
Crashaw's poetry (ed. J.R. Tutin, [ca. 1900]). Following a critical
introduction and table of contents, this work contains the following
major sections:
<list type="simple">
<item><title>Steps to the Temple</title> (a collection of
verse first published in 1648)</item>
<item><title>Carmen deo Nostro</title> (a second collection,
published in 1652)</item>
<item><title>The Delights of the Muses</title> (a third
collection, published in 1648)</item>
<item><title>Posthumous Poems,</title> I (a collection of
fragments all taken from a single manuscript)</item>
<item><title>Posthumous Poems,</title> II (a further collection
of fragments, taken from a different manuscript)</item></list>
 </p>
<p>Each of the three collections published in Crashaw's lifetime has a
reasonable claim to be considered as a text in its own right, and may
therefore be encoded as such. It is rather more arbitrary as to
whether the two posthumous collections should be treated as two
groups, following the practice of the <title>Muses Library</title>
edition. An encoder might elect to combine the two into a single
group, or simply to treat each fragment as an ungrouped unitary text.
 </p>
<p>The <title>Muses Library</title> edition reprints the whole of each
of the three original collections, including their original front
matter (title pages, dedications etc.). These should be encoded using
the <gi>front</gi> element and its constituents (on which see further
section <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/>), while the body of each collection
should be encoded as a single <gi>group</gi> element. Each individual
poem within the collections should be encoded as a distinct
<gi>text</gi> element. The beginning of the whole collection would
thus appear as follows (for further discussion of the use of the
elements <gi>div</gi> and <gi>lg</gi> for textual subdivision of
verse, see section <ptr target="#COVE"/> and chapter <ptr
target="#VE"/>): <egXML

 </p>
<p>The <gi>group</gi> element may be used in this way to encode any kind
of collection of which the constituents are regarded by the encoder as
texts in their own right.  Examples include anthologies of verse or
prose by multiple authors, collections, florilegia or commonplace books,
journals, day books, etc.  As a fairly typical example, we consider
<title>The Norton Book of Travel</title>, an anthology edited by Paul
Fussell and published in 1987 by W. W. Norton.  This work comprises
the following major sections:
<list type="ordered">
<item>Front matter (title page, acknowledgments, introductory essay)</item>
<item>The Beginnings</item>
<item>The Eighteenth Century and the Grand Tour</item>
<item>The Heyday</item>
<item>Touristic Tendencies</item>
<item>Post Tourism</item>
<item>Back matter (permissions list, index)</item></list>
Each titled section listed above comprises a group of extracts or
complete texts from writers of a given historical period, preceded by an
introductory essay.  For example, the second group listed above
contains, inter alia, the following:
<list type="ordered">
<item>Prefatory essay</item>
<item>Five letters by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</item>
<item>An extract from Swift's Gullivers Travels</item>
<item>Two poems by Alexander Pope</item>
<item>Two extracts from Boswell's Journal</item>
<item>A poem by William Blake</item></list>
Each group of writings by a single author is preceded by a brief
biographical notice.  Some of the extracts are quite lengthy, containing
several chapters or other divisions; others are quite short.  As the
above list indicates, the texts included range across all kinds of
material:  verse, prose, journals and letters.
 </p>
<p>The easiest way of encoding such an anthology is to treat each
individual extract as a text in its own right.  A sequence of texts by a
single author, together with the biographical note preceding it, can
then be treated as a single <gi>group</gi> element within the larger
<gi>group</gi> formed by the section.  The sequence of single or
composite texts making up a single section of the work is likewise
treated, together with its prefatory essay, as a single <gi>group</gi>
within the work.  Schematically:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text> 
<!-- the whole anthology -->
  <front>
<!-- title page, acknowledgments, introductory essay -->
  </front>
  <group> <!-- body of anthology starts here -->
    <group><head>The Beginnings</head>
       <!-- sequence of texts or groups -->
    </group>
    <group> <!-- The Eighteenth Century and the Grand Tour -->
      <text> <!-- prefatory essay by editor --> </text>
      <group> <!-- Section on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu starts -->     
        <text> <!-- biographical notice by editor -->     </text>
        <text>  <!-- first letter -->    </text>
        <text>  <!-- second letter -->    </text>
	<!-- ... -->
      </group>     <!-- end of Montagu section -->
      <text>     <!-- single text by Jonathan Swift starts -->
        <front> <!-- biographical notice by editor -->  </front>
        <body>    </body>
      </text>  <!-- end of Swift section -->  
      <group>  <!-- Section on Alexander Pope starts -->
        <text> <!-- biographical notice by editor --> </text>
        <text>  <!-- first poem --> </text>
        <text>  <!-- second poem --> </text>
      </group> <!-- end of Pope section -->
    <!-- ... -->
    </group> <!-- end of 18th century section --> 
    <group><head>The Heyday</head>
    <!-- texts and subgroups -->
    </group>
<!-- ... -->
  </group> <!-- end of the anthology proper -->
  <back> <!-- back matter for anthology --> </back>
</text> </egXML>
 </p>
<p>Note that the editor's introductory essays on each author may be
treated as texts in their own right (as the essays on Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu and Alexander Pope have been treated above), or as
front matter to the embedded text, as the essay on Swift has been.
The treatment in the example is intentionally inconsistent, to allow
comparison of the two approaches. Consistency can be imposed either
by treating the Swift section as a <gi>group</gi> containing one text
by Swift and one by the editor, or by treating the Montagu and Pope
sections as <gi>text</gi> elements containing the editor's essays as
front matter. Marked in the second way, the Pope section of the book
would look like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text>  <!-- Section on Alexander Pope starts -->
        <front> <!-- biographical notice by editor --> </front>
	<group>
	  <text>  <!-- first poem --> </text>
        <text>  <!-- second poem --> </text>
      </group>
      </text> <!-- end of Pope section-->   </egXML>
 </p>
<p>The essays on <q>The Eighteenth Century and the Grand Tour</q> and
other larger sections could also be tagged as <soCalled>front</soCalled>
matter in the same way, by treating the larger sections as <gi>text</gi>
elements rather than <gi>group</gi> elements.
 </p>
<p>Where, as in this case, an anthology contains different kinds of
text (for example, mixtures of prose and drama, or transcribed speech
and dictionary entries, or letters and verse), the elements to be
encoded will of course  be drawn from more than one  module.
The elements provided by the core module
described in chapter <ptr target="#CO"/> should however prove adequate
for most simple purposes, where prose, drama, and verse are combined
in a single collection.
 </p>
<p>For anthologies of short extracts such as commonplace books, it may
often be preferable to regard each extract not as a text in its own
right but simply as a quotation or <gi>cit</gi> element. The following
component-level elements may be used to encode quotations of this kind:
<specList><specDesc key="cit"/><specDesc key="quote"/></specList>
For example, the chapter of <soCalled>extracts</soCalled> which appears
in the front matter of Melville's <title>Moby Dick</title> might be
encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div n="2" type="chap">
  <head>Extracts</head>
  <head>(Supplied by a sub-sub-Librarian)</head>
  <p>It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and

<div xml:id="DSFLT"><head>Floating Texts</head>
<p>An important characteristic of the unitary or composite text
structures discussed so far is that they can be regarded as forming what is
mathematically known as a <term>tesselation</term> covering the whole
of the available text (or text division) at each hierarchic
level. Just as an XML document has a single root element containing
a single tree, each node of which forms a properly nested sub-tree, so
it seems natural to think of the internal structure of a text as
decomposable hierarchically into subparts, each of which is a
properly nested subtree. While this is undoubtedly true of a large
number of documents, it is not true of all. In particular, it is not
true of texts which are only partly  tesselated at a given level. For
example, if a text A is contained by text B in such a way that part of
B precedes A and part follows it, we cannot tesselate the whole of B.
In such a case, we say that text A is a <q>floating</q> text. </p>

<p>The <gi>floatingText</gi> element is a member of the <ident
type="class">model.divPart</ident> class, and can thus appear within
any division level element in the same way as a paragraph. For
example, texts such as the <title>Decameron</title> or the
<title>Arabian Nights</title> might be regarded as containing many
floating texts embedded within another single text, the framing
narrative, rather than as groups of discrete texts in which the
fragments of framing narrative are regarded as front or back matter.
</p>

<p>As an example, we consider an 18th century text <title>The Lining to
the <hi>Patch-Work Screen</hi></title>, by Jane Barker (1726). This 
lengthy narrative contains nearly a hundred distinct <q>tales</q>
embedded (as the title suggests) in a single patchwork. The work
begins by introducing the central character, Galecia, but within a few pages 
launches into a distinct narrative, the story of Captain Manly:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p>Galecia one Evening setting alone in her Chamber by a clear Fire,
and a clean Hearth ...  reflected on the Providence of our
All-wise and Gracious Creator.... </p>
<p>She was thus ruminating, when a Gentleman enter'd the Room, the
Door being a jar...  calling for a Candle, she beg'd a thousand
Pardons, engaged him to sit down, and let her know, what had so long
conceal'd him from her Correspondence.
</p>
<pb n="5"/>
<floatingText><body><head>The Story of <hi>Captain Manly</hi></head>
<p>Dear Galecia, said he, though you partly know the loose, or rather
lewd Life that I led in my Youth; yet I can't forbear relating part of
it to you by way of Abhorrence...
<!-- Captain Manly's story here -->
I had lost and spent all I had in the World; in which I verified the
Old Proverb, That a Rolling Stone never gathers Moss,
</p></body></floatingText>
<pb n="37"/>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of Captain Manly's tale, we are
returned to Galecia, and almost immediately after that into two further
stories. <!--This second story opens within a paragraph, to cope with which
we could use the sample and part attribute discussed above for div -->
However, the Galecia narrative returns between each of the texts,
which is why we choose to represent them as <gi>floatingtext</gi>s:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p>The Gentleman having finish'd his Story, Galecia waited on him to
the Stairs-head; and at her return, casting her Eyes on the Table, she
saw lying there an old dirty rumpled Book, and found in it the
following story: </p>
<floatingText><body><p> IN the time of the Holy War when
Christians from all parts went into the Holy Land to oppose the Turks;
Amongst these there was a certain English Knight...</p>
<!-- rest of story here -->
<p>The King graciously pardoned the Knight; Richard was kindly receiv'd
into his Convent, and all things went on in good order: But from hence
came the Proverb, We must not strike <hi>Robert</hi> for
<hi>Richard.</hi></p></body></floatingText>
<pb n="43"/>      
<p>By this time Galecia's Maid brought up her Supper; after which she
cast her Eyes again on the foresaid little Book, where she found the
following Story, which she read through before she went to bed.
</p>
<floatingText><body><head>The Cause of the Moors Overrunning
<hi>Spain</hi></head>
<p>King â€”â€”â€”â€” of Spain at his Death, committed the Government of his
Kingdom to his Brother Don â€”â€”â€” till his little Son should come of
Age ...</p>
<p>Thus the little Story ended, without telling what Misery
befel the King and Kingdom, by the Moors, who over ran the Country for
many Years after.  To which, we may well apply the Proverb,
<quote>
  <l>Who drives the Devil's Stages,</l>
  <l>Deserves the Devil's Wages</l>
</quote></p>
</body></floatingText>
<p>The reading this Trifle of a Story detained Galecia from her Rest
beyond her usual Hour; for she slept so sound the next Morning, that
she did not rise, till a Lady's Footman came to tell her, that his
Lady and another or two were coming to breakfast with her...
</p>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>In other multi-narrative texts, the individual nested tales may
have greater significance than the framing narratives, and it may
therefore be preferable to treat the fragments of framing narrative as
front or back matter associated with each nested tale. This is
commonly done, for example, in texts such as Chaucer's <title>Canterbury
Tales</title>, where each tale is typically presented with front matter in
which the teller of the tale is introduced, and back matter in which
the pilgrims comment on it.</p>

<p>The <gi>floatingText</gi> element should only be used for complete
texts which form a part of the text being encoded. Where a character
in one narrative quotes from some other text or narrative, fully or in
part, the <gi>quote</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>
should be used instead. </p>

</div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="DSFRONT"><head>Front Matter</head>
<p>By <term>front matter</term> we mean distinct sections of a text
(usually, but not exclusively, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of
introduction or identification as a part of its production. Features
such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite
case might be the prologue attached to a play.  The front matter of an
encoded text should not be confused with the TEI header described in
chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>, which serves as a kind of front matter for
the computer file itself, not the text it encodes.
 </p>
<p>An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text,
if the original presentation of the work is of no interest, or for
other reasons; alternatively some or all components of the front matter
may be thought worth including with the text as components of the
<gi>front</gi> element.<note place="foot">This decision should be recorded in the
<gi>samplingDecl</gi> element of the header.</note> With the exception of
the title page, (on which see section <ptr target="#DSTITL"/>), front
matter should be encoded using the same elements as the rest of a text.
As with the divisions of the text body, no other specific tags are
proposed here for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear
within front matter:  instead either numbered or un-numbered
<gi>div</gi> elements may be used.  The following suggested
values<note place="foot">As with all lists of <soCalled>suggested
values</soCalled> for attributes, it is recommended that software
written to handle TEI-conformant texts be prepared to recognize and
handle these values when they occur, without limiting the user to the
values in this list.</note>
for the <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish various
kinds of division characteristic of front matter:
<list type="gloss"><label><val>preface</val></label>
<item>A foreword or preface addressed to
    the reader in which the author or publisher explains the
    content, purpose, or origin of the text.</item><label><val>ack</val></label>
<item>A formal declaration of
    acknowledgment by the author in which persons and institutions
    are thanked for their part in the creation of a text.</item><label><val>dedication</val></label>
<item>A formal offering or dedication of
    a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author.</item><label><val>abstract</val></label>
<item>A summary of the content of a text as
    continuous prose.</item><label><val>contents</val></label>
<item>A table of contents, specifying the
    structure of a work and listing its constituents.
    The <gi>list</gi>
    element should be used to mark its structure.</item><label><val>frontispiece</val></label>
<item>A pictorial frontispiece,
    possibly including some text.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the
front matter of a text may be encoded.  The front part begins with a
title page, which is presented in section <ptr target="#DSTITL"/> below.
This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded
as a distinct <gi>div</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="dedication">
  <p>To my parents, Ida and Max Fish</p>
</div>
<div type="preface"><head>Preface</head>
  <p>The answer this book gives to its title question is <q>there is
      and there isn't</q>.</p>
  <p>Chapters 1â€“12 have been previously published in the
    following journals and collections:
    <list>
      <item>chapters 1 and 3 in <title>New literary History</title></item>
      <item>chapter 10 in <title>Boundary II</title> (1980)</item>
    </list>.
    I am grateful for permission to reprint.</p>
  <signed>S.F.</signed>
</div></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The front matter concludes with another <gi>div</gi> element, shown
in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which
contains a <gi>list</gi> element (as described in section 
<ptr target="#COLI"/>).  Note the use of the <gi>ptr</gi> element to provide
page-references:  the implication here is that the target identifiers
supplied (fish1, fish2 etc.) will correspond with identifiers used  for
the <gi>div</gi> elements containing chapters of the text itself. (For the
<gi>ptr</gi> element, see <ptr target="#COXR"/>.)  
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="contents">

</egXML>
Alternatively, the pointers in the index might link to the page breaks
at which a chapter begins, assuming that these have been included in
the markup:
<egXML	 xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><!-- .... -->

</egXML>
 </p>
<p>The following example uses numbered divisions to mark up the front
matter of a medieval text. 
Note that in this case no title page in the modern
sense occurs; the title is simply given as a heading at the start of the
front matter. Note also the use of the <att>type</att> attribute on the
<gi>div</gi> elements to indicate document elements comparatively
unusual in modern books such as the initial prayer:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><front>

<div type="div2" xml:id="DSTITL"><head>Title Pages</head>
<p>Detailed analysis of the title page and other
<term>preliminaries</term> of older printed books and manuscripts is of
major importance in descriptive bibliography and the cataloguing of
printed books; such analysis may require a rather more detailed module
than that proposed here.<!--note place="foot">Definition of such a module remains
a work item for the TEI; such modules for contemporary printed matter
already exist or are being created within the publishing industry, for
example the Majour (Modular Application for Journals) Project of the
European Workgroup on SGML. See for example <bibl><title>MAJOUR:
Modular Application for Journals: DTD for Article Headers</title>
([n.p.]: EWS, 1991).</bibl></note--> The following elements are
suggested as a means of encoding the major features of most title pages:
<specList>
<specDesc key="titlePage"/>
<specDesc key="docTitle"/>
<specDesc key="titlePart" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="argument"/>
<specDesc key="byline"/>
<specDesc key="docAuthor"/>

<specDesc key="imprimatur"/>
<specDesc key="docEdition"/>
<specDesc key="docImprint"/>
<specDesc key="docDate"/>
<specDesc key="graphic"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>Together with the <gi>figure</gi> element described in chapter
<ptr target="#FT"/>, these elements constitute the element class
<ident type="class">model.titlepagePart</ident>. Any number of elements from this class can
appear grouped together within a <gi>titlePage</gi> element. The
<gi>figure</gi> element is included so as to enable encoders to
record the presence of complex non-textual material on a title
page. For simple cases such as printers' ornaments, illustrations,
etc. the <gi>graphic</gi> element discussed in section <ptr
target="#COGR"/> should be adequate.  </p>
<p>The elements listed above, together with the <gi>head</gi> element,
also constitute the element class <ident type="class">model.pLike.front</ident>. The elements
in this class can appear within a <soCalled>minimal</soCalled>
<gi>front</gi> element without any need to group them together and
encode a complete title page.</p>
<p>Encoders wishing to add new elements to either class may do so using the
methods described in section <ptr target="#MD"/>. Two examples of the use of these elements
follow. First, the title page of the work discussed earlier in this
section:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><front>
  <titlePage>
    <docTitle>
      <titlePart type="main">Is There a Text in This Class?</titlePart>

      <pubPlace>London, England</pubPlace>
    </docImprint>
  </titlePage></front></egXML></p>
<p>Second, a characteristically verbose 17th century example. Note the
use of the <gi>lb</gi> tag to mark the line breaks of the original
where necessary:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><titlePage>
  <docTitle>

  </docImprint></titlePage></egXML></p>
<p>Those elements in the above list which are not defined elsewhere have
the following formal declarations:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSTPAGE" >
<!--n="Tags for title pages"-->
&titlePage;
&docTitle;
&titlePart;
&docAuthor;
&imprimatur;
&docEdition;
&docImprint;
&docDate;
</specGrp>
 </p>
<p>Where title pages are encoded, their physical rendition is
often of considerable importance.  One approach to this requirement
would be to use the <gi>seg</gi> tag, described in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>, to segment the typographic content of each part of the
title page, and then use the global <att>rend</att> attribute to specify
its rendition.  Another would be to use a module specialized for the
description of typographic entities such as pages, lines, rules, etc.,
bearing special-purpose attributes to describe line height, leading,
degree of kerning, font, etc. Further discussion of these problems is
provided in chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>.
 </p>
<p>Front matter elements:
<specGrp xml:id="DDSFRONT">
&front;
<specGrpRef target="#DDSTPAGE"/>
</specGrp>
 </p></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="DSBACK"><head>Back Matter</head>
<p>Conventions vary as to which elements are grouped as back matter and
which as front.  For example, some books place the table of contents at
the front, and others at the back.  Even title pages may appear at the
back of a book as well as at the front.  The content model for
<gi>back</gi> and <gi>front</gi> elements are therefore identical.
 </p>
<p>The following suggested values may be used for the <att>type</att>
attribute on all division elements, in order to distinguish various
kinds of division characteristic of back matter:
<list type="gloss"><label><val>appendix</val></label>
<item>An ancillary self-contained section of
a work, often providing additional but in some sense extra-canonical
text.</item><label><val>glossary</val></label>
<item>A list of terms associated with definition texts
(<soCalled>glosses</soCalled>): this should be encoded as a <tag>list type="gloss"</tag>
(see section <ptr target="#COLI"/>).</item><label><val>notes</val></label>
<item>A section in which textual or
other kinds of notes are gathered together.</item><label><val>bibliogr</val></label>
<item>A list of bibliographic citations: this should be encoded
as a <gi>listBibl</gi> (see section <ptr target="#COBI"/>).</item><label><val>index</val></label>
<item>Any form of index to the work.</item><label><val>colophon</val></label>
<item>A statement appearing at the end of a book describing the
conditions of its physical production.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>No additional elements are proposed for the encoding of back matter
at present.  Some characteristic examples follow; first, an index (for
the case in which a printed index is of sufficient interest to merit
transcription):
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back>  
<div type="index">
  <head>Index</head>
  <list type="index">
  <item>Actors, public, paid for the contempt attending
    their profession, <ref>263</ref></item>
  <item>Africa, cause assigned for the barbarous state of
    the interior parts of that continent, <ref>125</ref></item>
  <item>Agriculture
    <list type="indexentry">
    <item>ancient policy of Europe unfavourable to, <ref>371</ref></item>
    <item>artificers necessary to carry it on, <ref>481</ref></item>
    <item>cattle and tillage mutually improve each other, <ref>325</ref></item>
    <item>wealth arising from more solid than that which proceeds
    from commerce <ref>520</ref></item>
    </list></item>
  <item>Alehouses, not the efficient cause of drunkenness, <ref>461</ref></item>
  </list>
</div>
</back></egXML>
<!-- Smith, Wealth of Nations, 1776; index to vol 1 -->
Note that if the page breaks in the original source have also been
explicitly encoded, and given identifiers, the references to them in the
above index can more usefully be recorded as links. For example,
assuming that the encoding of page 461 of the original source starts
like this:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb xml:id="P461"/></egXML>
then the last item above might be encoded more usefully in either
of the following forms:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">  <item>Alehouses, not
the efficient cause of drunkenness, <ref target="#P461">461</ref></item>
  <item>Alehouses, not the efficient cause of drunkenness, <ptr target="#P461"/></item>
</egXML></p>
<p>Next, a back-matter division in epistolary form:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back>  
  <div type="letter">

      than I can utter or thou conceiue. ...

<!-- Greene, Groatsworth of witte, 1592 --></p>
<p>And finally, a list of corrigenda and addenda with pseudo-epistolary
features:
