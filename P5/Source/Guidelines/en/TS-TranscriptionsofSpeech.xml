<head>Transcriptions of Speech</head>
<note place="divtop">This chapter has not yet been revised to reflect
developments in the field of speech transcription and multimodal
language annotation since its first publication. It is planned that
a future revision of these Guidelines will include recommendations in
these areas, which will in turn imply some revision of the features discussed
here.</note>
<p>The module described in
this chapter is intended for use with a wide variety of transcribed
spoken material.  It should be stressed, however, that the present
proposals are not intended to support unmodified every variety of
research undertaken upon spoken material now or in the future; some
discourse analysts, some phonologists, and doubtless others may wish
to extend the scheme presented here to express more precisely the set
of distinctions they wish to draw in their transcriptions.  Speech
regarded as a purely acoustic phenomenon may well require different
methods from those outlined here, as may speech regarded solely as a
process of social interaction.
</p>
<p>This chapter begins with a discussion of some of the problems
commonly encountered in transcribing spoken language (section <ptr target="#TSOV"/>).  Section <ptr target="#TSBA"/> describes the basic
structural elements of this module.  Finally, section <ptr target="#TSSA"/> of this chapter reviews further problems specific to the
encoding of spoken language, demonstrating how mechanisms and elements
discussed elsewhere in these Guidelines may be applied to them.</p>
<p>The overall structure of a TEI spoken text is identical to that of
any other TEI text:  the <gi>TEI</gi> element for a spoken text
contains a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, followed by a <gi>text</gi>
element.  Even texts primarily composed of transcribed speech may also
include conventional front and back matter, and may even be organized
into divisions like printed texts. A complete transcript following
these Guidelines should therefore include the header, structure, tei,
and (in all probability) the common core modules along with the module
described in this chapter.</p>
<p>This module makes available the following components:
<moduleSpec xml:id="DTS" ident="spoken">
<altIdent type="FPI">Transcribed Speech</altIdent>
<desc>Transcribed Speech</desc></moduleSpec>


The selection and combination of modules to form a TEI schema is described in
<ptr target="#STIN"/>.

<div type="div2" xml:id="TSOV"><head>General Considerations and Overview</head>
<p>There is great variation in the ways different researchers have
chosen to represent speech using the written medium.<note place="foot">For a
discussion of several of these see <bibl>J.  A. Edwards and M. D.
Lampert, eds., <title>Talking Language:  Transcription and Coding of
Spoken Discourse</title> (Hillsdale, N.J.:  Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,
1993)</bibl>; <bibl>Stig Johansson, <title level="a">Encoding a Corpus
in Machine-Readable Form,</title> in <title>Computational Approaches
to the Lexicon:  An Overview,</title> ed.  B. T. S. Atkins et al.
(Oxford:  Oxford University Press, forthcoming)</bibl>; and
<bibl>Stig Johansson et al.  <title>Working Paper on Spoken
Texts,</title> document TEI AI2 W1, 1991</bibl>.</note> This
reflects the special difficulties which apply to the encoding or <term rend="noindex">transcription</term> of speech.  Speech varies according to
a large number of dimensions, many of which have no counterpart in
writing (for example, tempo, loudness, pitch, etc.).  The audibility of
speech recorded in natural communication situations is often less than
perfect, affecting the accuracy of the transcription.  Spoken material
may be transcribed in the course of linguistic, acoustic,
anthropological, psychological, ethnographic, journalistic, or many
other types of research.  Even in the same field, the interests and
theoretical perspectives of different transcribers may lead them to
prefer different levels of detail in the transcript and different styles
of visual display.  The production and comprehension of speech are
intimately bound up with the situation in which speech occurs, far more
so than is the case for written texts.  A speech transcript must
therefore include some contextual features; determining which are
relevant is not always simple.  Moreover, the ethical problems in
recording and making public what was produced in a private setting and
intended for a limited audience are more frequently encountered in
dealing with spoken texts than with written ones.
 </p>
<p>Speech also poses difficult structural problems.  Unlike a written
text, a speech event takes place in time.  Its beginning and end may be
hard to determine and its internal composition difficult to define.
Most researchers agree that the utterances or <term>turns</term> of
individual speakers form an important structural component in most kinds
of speech, but these are rarely as well-behaved (in the structural
sense) as paragraphs or other analogous units in written texts:
speakers frequently interrupt each other, use gestures as well as words,
leave remarks unfinished and so on.  Speech itself, though it may be
represented as words, frequently contains items such as vocalized pauses
which, although only semi-lexical, have immense importance in the
analysis of spoken text.  Even non-vocal elements such as gestures may
be regarded as forming a component of spoken text for some analytic
purposes.
Below the level of the individual utterance, speech may be segmented
into units defined by phonological, prosodic, or syntactic phenomena;
no clear agreement exists, however, even as to appropriate names for
such segments.
 </p>
<p>Spoken texts transcribed according to the guidelines presented here
are organized as follows.  As noted above, speech is regarded as being
composed of arbitrary high-level units called
<term rend="noindex">texts</term>.<index><term>texts</term><index><term>as organizing unit for spoken material</term></index></index>
A spoken <gi>text</gi> might typically be a conversation between a small
number of people, a lecture, a broadcast TV item, or a similar event.
Each such unit has associated with it a <gi>teiHeader</gi> providing
detailed contextual information such as the source of the transcript,
the identity of the participants, whether the speech is scripted or
spontaneous, the physical and social setting in which the discourse
takes place and a range of other aspects.  For details of the header in
general, refer to chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>; for details of additional
elements for the documentation of participant and contextual
information, see section <ptr target="#CCAH"/>.
 </p>
<p>Defining the bounds of a spoken text is frequently a matter of
arbitrary convention or convenience.  In public or semi-public contexts,
a text may be regarded as synonymous with, for example, a <term rend="noindex">lecture</term>, a <term rend="noindex">broadcast item</term>,
a <term rend="noindex">meeting</term>, etc.  In informal or private
contexts, a text may be simply a conversation involving a specific group
of participants.  Alternatively, researchers may elect to define spoken
texts solely in terms of their duration in time or length in words.  By
default, these Guidelines assume of a text only that:
<list type="simple">
<item>it is internally cohesive,</item>
<item>it is describable by a single header, and</item>
<item>it represents a single stretch of time with no significant
discontinuities.</item></list>
Deviation from these assumptions may be specified (for example, the
<att>org</att> attribute on the <gi>text</gi> element may take the value
<val>compos</val> to specify that the components of the
text are discrete) but is not recommended.
 </p>
<p>Within a <gi>text</gi> it may be necessary to identify subdivisions
of various kinds, if only for convenience of handling.  The neutral
<gi>div</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#DSDIV"/> is
recommended for this purpose.  It may be found useful also for
representing subdivisions relating to discourse structure, speech act
theory, transactional analysis, etc., provided that these divisions
are hierarchically well-behaved.  Where they are not, as is often the
case, the mechanisms discussed in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/> and
<ptr target="#NH"/> may be used.
 </p>
<p>A spoken text may contain any of the following components:
<list type="simple">
<item>utterances</item>
<item>pauses</item>
<item>vocalized but non-lexical phenomena such as coughs</item>
<item>kinesic (non-verbal, non-lexical) phenomena such as gestures</item>
<item>entirely non-linguistic incidents occurring during and possibly
influencing the course of speech</item>
<item>writing, regarded as a special class of incident in that it can
be transcribed, for example captions or overheads displayed during
a lecture</item>
<item>shifts or changes in vocal quality</item></list>
 </p>
<p>Elements to represent all of these features of spoken language are
discussed in section <ptr target="#TSBA"/> below.
 </p>
<p>An utterance (tagged <gi>u</gi>) may contain lexical items
interspersed with pauses and non-lexical vocal sounds; during an
utterance, non-linguistic incidents may occur and written materials may be
presented.  The <gi>u</gi> element can thus contain any of the other
elements listed, interspersed with a transcription of the lexical items
of the utterance; the other elements may all appear between utterances
or next to each other, but except for <gi>writing</gi> they do not
contain any other elements nor any data.
 </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSOSDC"><head>Divisions</head>
<p>A spoken text itself may be without substructure, that is, it may
consist simply of units such as utterances or pauses, not grouped
together in any way, or it may be subdivided into one or more divisions
as described in this section.
 </p>
<p>If the notion of what constitutes a <soCalled>text</soCalled> in
spoken discourse is inevitably rather an arbitrary one, the notion of
formal subdivisions within such a <soCalled>text</soCalled> is even more
debatable.  Nevertheless, such divisions may be useful for such types of
discourse as debates, broadcasts, etc., where structural subdivisions
can easily be identified, or more generally wherever it is desired to
aggregate utterances or other parts of a transcript into units smaller
than a complete <soCalled>text</soCalled>.  Examples might include
<q>conversations</q> or <q>discourse fragments</q>, or more narrowly,
<q>that part of the conversation where topic x was discussed</q>,
provided only that the set of all such divisions is coextensive with the
text.
 </p>
<p>Each such division of a spoken text should be represented by the
numbered or un-numbered <gi>div</gi> elements defined in chapter <ptr target="#DS"/>.  For some detailed kinds of analysis a hierarchy of such
divisions may be found useful; nested <gi>div</gi> elements may be used
for this purpose, as in the example below.
 </p>
<p>The <gi>div</gi> element is a member of the <ident type="class">att.divLike</ident> class of structural elements, and therefore has
the following attributes in common with other members of the class:
<specList><specDesc key="att.divLike" atts="type org sample part"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to characterize divisions
in any way that is convenient; no specific recommendations are made in
these Guidelines.  For example, a collection made up of transcribed
<soCalled>sound bites</soCalled> taken from speeches given by a
politician on different occasions, might encode each extract as a
distinct <gi>div</gi>, nested within a single composite <gi>div</gi> as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="soundbites" org="composite">
   <div sample="medial">
   </div>
   <div sample="medial">
   </div>
   <div sample="initial">
   </div>
</div></egXML>
<!-- removed dur attribute on div                             -->
	<!-- The <att>dur</att> attribute may specify temporal        -->
	<!-- duration in any units convenient; for further            -->
	<!-- discussion of temporal alignment, see section <xref      -->
	<!-- target='SASY'>.                                          -->
 </p>
<p>As a member of the class <ident type="class">att.declaring</ident>, the
<gi>div</gi> element may also carry a <att>decls</att> attribute, for
use where the divisions of a text do not all share the same set of the
contextual declarations specified in the TEI header.  (See further
section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>).
</p> 
</div>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="TSBA"><head>Elements Unique to Spoken Texts</head>
<p>The following elements characterize spoken texts, transcribed
according to these Guidelines:
<specList><specDesc key="u"/><specDesc key="pause"/><specDesc key="vocal"/><specDesc key="kinesic"/><specDesc key="incident"/><specDesc key="writing"/><specDesc key="shift"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>These elements are all members of the <ident type="class">att.ascribed</ident> class, from which they inherit the
<att>who</att> attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.ascribed"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Each of these elements is further discussed and specified below in sections <ptr target="#TSBAUT"/>
 to <ptr target="#TSBAWR"/>.
 </p>
<p>We can show the relationship between four of these constituents of
speech using the features <ident type="feature">eventive</ident>, <ident type="feature">communicative</ident>, <ident type="feature">anthropophonic</ident> (for sounds produced by the human
vocal apparatus), and <ident type="feature">lexical</ident>:
<table>
<row role="label"><cell> </cell><cell>eventive</cell><cell>communicative</cell><cell>anthropophonic</cell><cell>lexical</cell></row>
<row><cell>incident</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell></row>
<row><cell>kinesic</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell></row>
<row><cell>vocal</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>-</cell></row>
<row><cell>utterance</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell><cell>+</cell></row>
</table>
The differences are not always clear-cut.  Among <term rend="noindex">incidents</term> might be included actions like slamming
the door, which can certainly be communicative.  <term rend="noindex">Vocals</term> include coughing and sneezing, which
are<index><term>vocal events</term><index><term>in
transcription of speech</term></index></index> usually
involuntary noises.  Equally, the distinction between utterances and
vocals is not always clear, although for many analytic purposes it
will be convenient to regard them as distinct.  Individual scholars
may differ in the way borderlines are drawn and should declare their
definitions in the <gi>editorialDecl</gi> element of the header (see
<ptr target="#HD53"/>).
 </p>
<p>The following short extract exemplifies several of these elements. It
is recoded from a text originally transcribed in the CHILDES
format.<note place="foot">The original is a conversation between two children and
their parents, recorded in 1987, and discussed in
<bibl><author>Brian MacWhinney</author>
<title>CHAT Manual</title>
([Pittsburgh]: Dept of Psychology, Carnegie-Mellon University,
1988), pp. 87ff.</bibl></note>
Each utterance is encoded using a <gi>u</gi> element (see section <ptr
target="#TSBAUT"/>). The speakers are defined using the
<gi>listPerson</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#NDPERSE"/> and each is
given a unique identifier also used to identify their speech. Pauses marked by the transcriber are indicated
using the <gi>pause</gi> element (see section <ptr target="#TSBAPA"/>).
Non-verbal vocal effects such as the child's meowing are indicated
either with orthographic transcriptions or with the <gi>vocal</gi>
element, and entirely non-linguistic but significant incidents such as
the sound of the toy cat are represented by the <gi>incident</gi>
elements (see section <ptr target="#TSBAVO"/>).
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#mar">you never <pause/> take this cat for show&amp;sp;and&amp;sp;tell
<pause/> meow meow</u>
<u who="#ros">yeah well I dont want to</u>
<incident><desc>toy cat has bell in tail which continues to make a tinkling sound</desc></incident>
<vocal who="#mar"><desc>meows</desc></vocal>
<u who="#ros">because it is so old</u>
<u who="#mar">how <choice><orig>bout</orig><reg>about</reg></choice>
  <emph>your</emph> cat <pause/>yours is  <emph>new</emph>
  <kinesic><desc>shows Father the cat</desc></kinesic> </u>
<u trans="pause" who="#fat">thats <pause/> darling</u>
<u who="#mar">no <emph>mine</emph> isnt old
mine is just um a little dirty</u>
<!-- ... -->
<listPerson>
<person xml:id="mar"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="ros"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="fat"><!-- ... --></person>
</listPerson></egXML>
<!-- from MacWhinney 88, 87, cited by SJ --></p>
<p>This example also uses some elements common to all TEI texts,
notably the <gi>reg</gi> tag for editorial regularization. The special
purpose entity reference <code>&amp;sp;</code> has been used to
indicate non-separating spaces; unusually stressed syllables have been
encoded with the <gi>emph</gi> element. The <gi>seg</gi> element has
also been used to segment the last utterance. Further discussion of
all of these options is provided in section <ptr target="#TSSA"/>.
 </p>
<p>Contextual information is of particular importance in spoken texts,
and should be provided by the TEI header of a text. In general, all
of the information in a header is understood to be relevant to the whole
of the associated text. The elements <gi>u</gi> and <gi>writing</gi>
are however members of the <ident type="class">att.declaring</ident> class,
and may therefore specify a different context from that of the
surrounding elements within a given division or text by means of the
<att>decls</att> attribute (see further section <ptr target="#CCAS"/>).
 </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSBAUT"><head>Utterances</head>
<p>Each distinct <term>utterance</term> in a spoken text is represented
by a <gi>u</gi> element, described as follows:
<specList><specDesc key="u" atts="trans"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>Use of the <att>who</att> attribute to associate the utterance with a
particular speaker is recommended but not required. Its use implies as
a further requirement that all speakers be identified by a
<gi>person</gi> or <gi>personGrp</gi> element in the TEI
header (see section <ptr target="#CCAHPA"/>). Where utterances cannot be
attributed with confidence to any particular participant or group of
participants, the encoder may choose to define
<soCalled>participants</soCalled> such as <ident type="var">all</ident> or
<ident type="var">various</ident>. </p>
<p>The <att>trans</att> attribute is provided as a means of
characterizing the transition from one utterance to the next at a
simpler level of detail than that provided by the temporal alignment
mechanism discussed in section <ptr target="#SASY"/>.  The value specified
applies to the transition from the preceding utterance into the
utterance bearing the attribute.  For example:<note place="foot">For
the most part, the examples in this chapter use no sentence punctuation
except to mark the rising intonation often found in interrogative
statements; for further discussion, see section <ptr target="#TSREG"/>.</note>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u xml:id="ts_a1" who="#a">Have you heard the</u>
<u xml:id="ts_b1" trans="latching" who="#b">the election results? yes</u>
<u xml:id="ts_a2" trans="pause" who="#a">it's a disaster</u>
<u xml:id="ts_b2" trans="overlap" who="#b">it's a miracle</u></egXML>
In this example, utterance B1 latches on to utterance A1, while there is
a marked pause between B1 and A2.  B2 and A2 overlap, but by an
unspecified amount.  For ways of providing a more precise indication of
the degree of overlap, see section <ptr target="#TSSAPA"/>.
 </p>
<p>An utterance may contain either running text, or text within which
other basic structural elements are nested.  Where such nesting occurs,
the <att>who</att> attribute is considered to be inherited for the
elements <gi>pause</gi>, <gi>vocal</gi>, <gi>shift</gi> and
<gi>kinesic</gi>; that is, a pause or shift (etc.) within an utterance
is regarded as being produced by that speaker only, while a pause
between utterances applies to all speakers.
 </p>
<p>Occasionally, an utterance may seem to contain other utterances,
for example where one speaker interrupts himself,  or 
when another speaker produces a <soCalled>back channel</soCalled>
while they are still speaking.  The present version of these
Guidelines does not support nesting of one <gi>u</gi> element within
another. The transcriber must therefore decide whether such
interruptions constitute a change of utterance, or whether other
elements may be used. In the case of self-interruption, the
<gi>shift</gi> element may be used to show that the speaker has
changed the quality of their speech:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u
who="#a">Listen to this <shift new="reading"/>The government is
confident, he said, that the current economic problems will be
completely overcome by June<shift/> what nonsense</u></egXML> 
Alternatively the <gi>incident</gi> element described in section <ptr
target="#TSBAVO"/> might be used, without transcribing the read material: <egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#a">Listen to this
<incident><desc>reads aloud from newspaper</desc></incident> what
nonsense</u></egXML> 
</p>
<p>Often, back channelling is only semi-lexicalized and may therefore be
represented using the <gi>vocal</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u
who="#a">So what could I have done <vocal
who="#b"><desc>tut-tutting</desc></vocal> about it anyway?</u></egXML>
Where this is not possible, it is simplest to regard the back channel
as a distinct utterance.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSBAPA"><head>Pause</head>
<p>The <gi>pause</gi> empty element is used to indicate a perceived
pause, either between or within utterances.
<specList><specDesc key="pause"/></specList>
A pause contained by an utterance applies to the speaker of that
utterance.  A pause between utterances applies to all speakers.  The
<att>type</att> attribute may be used to categorize the pause, for
example as short, medium or long; alternatively the attribute
<att>dur</att> may be used to indicate its length more exactly, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u>Okay <pause dur="PT2M"/>U-m<pause dur="PT75S"/>the scene opens up
<pause dur="PT50S"/> with <pause dur="PT20S"/> um <pause dur="PT145S"/> you see
a tree okay?</u></egXML>
<!-- example recoded from Chafe  -->
If detailed synchronization of pausing with other vocal phenomena is
required, the alignment mechanism defined at section <ptr target="#SASY"/>
and discussed informally below should be used.  Note that the
<att>trans</att> attribute mentioned in the previous section may also be
used to characterize the degree of pausing between (but not within)
utterances.
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSBAVO"><head>Vocal, Kinesic, Incident</head>
<p>These three empty elements are used to indicate the presence of
non-transcribed semi-lexical or non-lexical phenomena either between or
within utterances.
<specList><specDesc key="vocal"/><specDesc key="kinesic"/><specDesc key="incident"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The <att>who</att> attribute should be used to specify the person or
group responsible for a vocal, kinesic or incident which is contained
within an utterance, if this differs from that of the enclosing
utterance.  The attribute must be supplied for a vocal, kinesic or incident
which is not contained within an utterance.
 </p>
<p>The <att>iterated</att> attribute may be used to indicate that the
vocal, kinesic or incident is repeated, for example <val>laughter</val> as opposed to <val>laugh</val>.
These should both be distinguished from <val>laughing</val>,
where what is being encoded is a shift in voice quality.  For this last
case, the <gi>shift</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#TSSASH"/> should be used.
 </p>
<p>The <att>desc</att> attribute may be used to supply a conventional
representation for the phenomenon, for example:
<list type="gloss"><label>non-lexical </label>
<item>burp, click, cough, exhale, giggle, gulp,
    inhale, laugh, sneeze, sniff, snort, sob, swallow, throat, yawn
    </item><label>semi-lexical </label>
<item>ah, aha, aw, eh, ehm, er, erm, hmm, huh,
    mm, mmhm, oh, ooh, oops, phew, tsk, uh, uh-huh, uh-uh, um, urgh,
    yup</item></list>
Researchers may prefer to regard some semi-lexical phenomena as
<soCalled>words</soCalled> within the bounds of the <gi>u</gi> element.
See further the discussion at section <ptr target="#TSREG"/> below.  As
for all basic categories, the definition should be made clear in the
<gi>encodingDesc</gi> element of the TEI header.
 </p>
<p>Some typical examples follow (recoded from
<bibl><editor>J. Maxwell Atkinson and John Heritage</editor> eds.,
<title>Transcript notation. Structures of social action: Studies in
conversation analysis,</title> Cambridge University Press,
1984</bibl>).
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#jan">This is just delicious</u>
<incident><desc>telephone rings</desc></incident>
<u who="#ann">I'll get it</u>
<u who="#tom">I used to <vocal><desc>cough</desc></vocal> smoke a lot</u>
<u who="#bob"><vocal><desc>sniffs</desc></vocal>He thinks he's tough</u>
<vocal who="#ann"><desc>snorts</desc></vocal>
<!-- ... -->
<listPerson>
<person xml:id="ann"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="bob"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="jan"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="kim"><!-- ... --></person>
<person xml:id="tom"><!-- ... --></person>
</listPerson>

</egXML>
Note that Ann's snorting could equally well be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#ann">
   <vocal><desc>snorts</desc></vocal>
</u></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The extent to which encoding of incidents or kinesics is included in a
transcription will depend entirely on the purpose for which the
transcription was made.  As elsewhere, this will depend on the
particular research agenda and the extent to which their presence is
felt to be significant for the interpretation of spoken interactions.
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSBAWR"><head>Writing</head>
<p>Written text may also be encountered when speech is transcribed, for
example in a television broadcast or cinema performance, or where one
participant shows written text to another.  The <gi>writing</gi> element
may be used to distinguish such written elements from the spoken text in
which they are embedded.
<specList><specDesc key="writing" atts="gradual type"/></specList>
<!-- example needed -->
For example, if speaker A in the breakfast table conversation in section <ptr target="#TSBAUT"/>
 above had simply shown the newspaper passage to her
interlocutor instead of reading it, the interaction might have been
encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#a">look at this</u>
<writing who="#a" type="newspaper" gradual="false">
   The government is confident, he said, that the
   current economic problems will be completely overcome
   by June</writing>
<u who="#a">what nonsense!</u></egXML>
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSBATI"><head>Temporal Information</head>
<p>In addition to the global attributes <att>n</att>,
<att>xml:id</att>, and <att>xml:lang</att>, utterances, vocals,
pauses, kinesics, incidents, and writing elements may all take a common
set of attributes providing information about their position in time.
For this reason, these elements are regarded as forming a
<term>class</term>, referred to here as <name
type="class">att.timed</name>. The following attributes are common to
all elements in this class: <specList><specDesc key="att.timed"
atts="start end"/></specList> In addition, since <name
type="class">att.timed</name> is a member of <name
type="class">att.duration</name>, itself a member of <name type="class">att.duration.w3c</name>,
these elements also share the following attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.duration.w3c" atts="dur"/></specList>
 Note that if <att>start</att> and
<att>end</att> point to <gi>when</gi> elements whose temporal distance
from each other is specified in a timeline, then <att>dur</att> is

<p>The <gi>anchor</gi> element (see <ptr target="#SACS"/>) may be used as
an alternative means of aligning the start and end of timed elements,
and is required when the temporal alignment involves points within an
element.
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSSASH"><head>Shifts</head>
<p>A common requirement in transcribing spoken language is to mark
positions at which a variety of prosodic features change.  Many
paralinguistic features (pitch, prominence, loudness, etc.) characterize
stretches of speech which are not co-extensive with utterances or any of
the other units discussed so far.  One simple method of encoding such
units is simply to mark their boundaries.  An empty element called
<gi>shift</gi> is provided for this purpose.
<specList><specDesc key="shift" atts="feature new"/></specList>
A <gi>shift</gi> element may appear within an utterance or a segment to
mark a significant change in the particular feature defined by its
attributes, which is then understood to apply to all subsequent
utterances for the same speaker, unless changed by a new shift for the
same feature in the same speaker.  Intervening utterances by other
speakers do not normally carry the same feature.
For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u><shift feature="loud" new="f"/>Elizabeth</u>
<u>Yes</u>
<u><shift feature="loud" new="normal"/>Come and try this <pause/>
     <shift feature="loud" new="ff"/>come on</u></egXML>
In this example, the word <mentioned>Elizabeth</mentioned> is spoken loudly, the
words <mentioned>Yes</mentioned> and <mentioned>Come and try this</mentioned> with
normal volume, and the words <mentioned>come on</mentioned> very loudly.
 </p>
<p>The values proposed here for the <att>feature</att> attribute are
based on those used by the Survey of English Usage;<note place="foot">For details see <bibl>S. Boase, <title>London-Lund
Corpus: Example Text and Transcription Guide</title> (London: Survey
of English Usage, University College London, 1990)</bibl>.</note> this
list may be revised or supplemented using the methods outlined in
section <ptr target="#MD"/>. </p>
<p>The <att>new</att> attribute specifies the new state of the feature
following the shift.  If no value is specified, it is implied that the
feature concerned ceases to be remarkable at this point:  the special
value <val>normal</val> may be specified to have the same
effect.</p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="TSSA"><head>Elements Defined Elsewhere</head>
<p>This section describes the following features characteristic of
spoken texts for which elements are defined elsewhere in these
Guidelines:
<list type="simple">
<item>segmentation below the utterance level</item>
<item>synchronization and overlap</item>
<item>regularization of orthography</item></list> The elements
discussed here are not provided by the module for spoken texts.  Some
of them are included in the core module and others are contained in
the modules for linking and for analysis respectively.  The selection
of modules and their combination to define a TEI schema is discussed
in section <ptr target="#STIN"/>.


<!-- I still think it's completely bonkers not to define timeline here. LB --></p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSSASE"><head>Segmentation</head>
<p>For some analytic purposes it may be desirable to subdivide the
divisions of a spoken text into units smaller than the individual
utterance or turn.  Segmentation may be performed for a number of
different purposes and in terms of a variety of speech phenomena.
Common examples include units defined both prosodically (by intonation,
pausing, etc.) and syntactically (clauses, phrases, etc.)  The term
<term>macrosyntagm</term> has been used by a number of researchers to
define units peculiar to speech transcripts.<note place="foot">The term was
apparently first proposed by <bibl><author>Bengt Loman and Nils
Jørgensen</author> in <title>Manual for analys och beskrivning
av makrosyntagmer</title> (Lund: Studentlitteratur, 1971)</bibl>,
where it is defined as follows: <q>A text can be analysed as a sequence
of segments which are internally connected by a network of syntactic
relations and externally delimited by the absence of such relations with
respect to neighbouring segments. Such a segment is a syntactic unit
called a macrosyntagm</q> (trans. S. Johansson).</note></p>
<p>These Guidelines propose that such analyses be performed in terms of
neutrally-named <term>segments</term>, represented by the <gi>seg</gi>
element, which is discussed more fully in section <ptr target="#SASE"/>.
This element may take a <att>type</att> attribute to specify the kind of
segmentation applicable to a particular segment, if more than one is
possible in a text.  A full definition of the segmentation scheme or
schemes used should be provided in the <gi>segmentation</gi> element of
the <gi>editorialDecl</gi> element in the TEI header (see <ptr target="#HD53"/>).</p>
<p>In the first example below, an utterance has been segmented according
to a notion of syntactic completeness not necessarily marked by the
speech, although in this case a pause has been recorded between the two
sentence-like units.  In the second, the segments are defined
prosodically (an acute accent 
has been used to mark the position immediately following the syllable
bearing the primary accent or stress), and may be thought of as
<soCalled>tone units</soCalled>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u>
   <seg>we went to the pub yesterday</seg>
   <pause/>
   <seg>there was no one there</seg>
</u>
<u>
   <seg>although its an old ide´a</seg>
   <seg>it hasnt been on the mar´ket very long</seg>
</u></egXML>
<!-- examples from J Payne NERC Report -->
In either case, the <gi>segmentation</gi> element in the header of the
text should specify the principles adopted to define the segments marked
in this way.</p>
<p>When utterances are segmented end-to-end in the same way as the
s-units in written texts, the <gi>s</gi> element discussed in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>
 may be used, either as an alternative or in addition to
the more general purpose <gi>seg</gi> element.  The <gi>s</gi> element
is available without formality in all texts, but does not allow segments
to nest within each other.
</p>
<p>Where segments of different kinds are to be distinguished within the
same stretch of speech, the <att>type</att> attribute may be used, as in
the following example.  The example also shows the use of a
user-specified extension to the TEI modules, for specifying
paraphasia.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<u who="#T1">

<!-- <note>Reference needed!</note>                           -->
In this example, recoded from a corpus of language-impaired speech
prepared by Fletcher and Garman, the speaker's utterance has been fully
segmented into clausal (<code>type="C"</code>) 
or minor (<code>type="M"</code>) units.  An additional 
element <gi>paraphasia</gi> has been used to define a particular
characteristic of this corpus for which no element exists in the TEI scheme.
See further chapter <ptr target="#MD"/> for a discussion of the way in
which this kind of user-defined extension of the TEI scheme may be
performed and chapter <ptr target="#ST"/> for the mechanisms on which it
depends.</p>
<p>This example also uses the core elements <gi>gap</gi> and
<gi>del</gi> to mark editorial decisions concerning matter completely
omitted from the transcript (because of inaudibility), and words which
have been transcribed but which the transcriber wishes to exclude from
the segment because they are repeated, respectively.  See
section <ptr target="#COED"/> for a discussion of these and related
elements.</p>
<p>It is often the case that the desired segmentation does not respect
utterance boundaries; for example, syntactic units may cross utterance
boundaries.  For a detailed discussion of this problem, and the various
methods proposed by these Guidelines for handling it, see chapter
<ptr target="#NH"/>. Methods discussed there include these:
<list type="simple">
<item><soCalled>milestone</soCalled> tags may be used;
the special-purpose <gi>shift</gi> tag discussed
in section <ptr target="#TSSASH"/> is an extension of this method</item>
<item>where several discontinuous segments are to be grouped
together to form a syntactic unit (e.g. a phrasal verb with interposed
complement), the <gi>join</gi> element may be used</item>
<item>if SGML is in use, a concurrent DTD may be defined</item>
</list></p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSSAPA"><head>Synchronization and Overlap</head>
<p>A major difference between spoken and written texts is the importance
of the temporal dimension to the former.  As a very simple example,
consider the following, first as it might be represented in a
playscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Jane: Have you read Vanity Fair?
Stig: Yes
Lou: (nods vigorously)</egXML>
To encode this, we first define the participants:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><listPerson>
<person xml:id="stig"> <!-- ... --> </person>
<person xml:id="lou"> <!-- ... --> </person>
<person xml:id="jane"> <!-- ... --> </person>
</listPerson></egXML>
Let us assume that Stig and Lou respond to Jane's question before she
has finished asking it — a fairly normal situation in spontaneous
speech.  The simplest way of representing this <term>overlap</term>
would be to use the <att>trans</att> attribute previously discussed:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#jane">have you read Vanity Fair</u>
<u trans="overlap" who="#stig">yes</u>
</egXML>
However, this does not allow us to indicate either the extent to which
Stig's utterance is overlapped, nor does it show that there are in
fact three things which are synchronous:  the end of Jane's utterance,
Stig's whole utterance, and Lou's kinesic.  To overcome these problems,
more sophisticated techniques, employing the mechanisms for pointing and
alignment discussed in detail in section <ptr target="#SASY"/>, are needed.
If the module for linking has been enabled (as described in
section <ptr target="#TSSASE"/> above), one way to represent the simple
example above would be as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u xml:id="utt1" who="#jane">have you read Vanity <anchor synch="#utt2 #k1" xml:id="a1"/> Fair</u>
<u xml:id="utt2" who="#stig">yes</u>
<kinesic xml:id="k1" who="#lou" iterated="true"><desc>nods head vertically</desc></kinesic></egXML></p>
<p>For a full discussion of this and related mechanisms, section <ptr target="#SASYMP"/> should be consulted. The rest of the present
section, which should be read in conjunction with that more detailed
discussion, presents a number of ways in which these mechanisms may be
applied to the specific problem of representing temporal alignment,
synchrony or overlap in transcribing spoken texts.</p>
<p>In the simple example above, the first utterance (that with
identifier u1) contains an <gi>anchor</gi> element, the function of
which is simply to mark a point within it. The <att>synch</att>
attribute associated with this anchor point specifies the identifiers of
the other two elements which are to be synchronized with it:
specifically, the second utterance (u2) and the kinesic (k1). Note that
one of these elements has content and the other is empty.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates only a way of indicating a point within one
utterance at which it can be synchronized with another utterance and a
kinesic. For more complex kinds of alignment, involving possibly
multiple synchronization points, an additional element is provided,
known as a <gi>timeline</gi>. This consists of a series of
<gi>when</gi> elements, each representing a point in time, and bearing
attributes which indicate its exact temporal position relative to other
elements in the same timeline, in addition to the sequencing implied by
its position within it.</p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline unit="s" origin="#TS-P1">
   <when xml:id="TS-P1" absolute="12:20:01"/>
   <when xml:id="TS-P2" interval="4.5" since="#TS-P1"/>
   <when xml:id="TS-P6"/>
   <when xml:id="TS-P3" interval="1.5" since="#TS-P6"/>
</timeline></egXML>
This timeline represents four points in time, named TS-P1, TS-P2, TS-P6, and TS-P3
(as with all attributes named <att>xml:id</att> in the TEI scheme, the
names must be unique within the document but have no other
significance).  TS-P1 is located absolutely, at 12:20:01:01 BST.  TS-P2 is 4.5
seconds later than TS-P2 (i.e. at 12:20:46).  TS-P6 is
at some unspecified time later than TS-P2 and previous to TS-P3 (this is
implied by its position within the timeline, as no attribute values have
been specified for it).  The fourth point, TS-P3, is 1.5 seconds 
later than TS-P6.</p>
<p>One or more such timelines may be specified within a spoken text, to
suit the encoder's convenience.  If more than one is supplied, the
<att>origin</att> attribute may be used on each to specify which other
<gi>timeline</gi> element it follows.  The <att>unit</att> attribute
indicates the units used for timings given on <gi>when</gi> elements
contained by the alignment map.  Alternatively, to avoid the need to
specify times explicitly, the <att>interval</att> attribute may be used
to indicate that all the <gi>when</gi> elements in a time line are a
fixed distance apart.</p>
<p>Three methods are available for aligning points or elements within a
spoken text with the points in time defined by the <gi>timeline</gi>:
<list type="simple">
<item>The elements to be synchronized may specify the identifier
of a <gi>when</gi> element as the value of one of the <att>start</att>,
<att>end</att> or <att>synch</att> attributes</item>
<item>The <gi>when</gi>
element may specify the identifiers of all the elements to be
synchronized with it using the <att>synch</att> attribute</item>
<item>A
free-standing <gi>link</gi> element may be used to associate the
<gi>when</gi> element and the elements synchronized with it by
specifying their identifiers as values for its <att>target</att>
attribute.</item></list></p>
<p>For example, using the timeline given above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u xml:id="TS-U1" start="#TS-P2" end="#TS-P3">This is my <anchor synch="#TS-P6" xml:id="TS-P6A"/> turn</u></egXML>
The start of utterance TS-U1 is aligned with TS-P2 and its end with TS-P3.  The
transition between the words <mentioned>my</mentioned> and <mentioned>turn</mentioned>
occurs at point TS-P6A, which is synchronous with point TS-P6 on the timeline.</p>
<p>The synchronization represented by the preceding examples could
equally well be represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline origin="#ts-p1" unit="s">
  <when xml:id="ts-p1" absolute="12:20:01"/>
  <when synch="#ts-u1" xml:id="ts-p2" interval="4.5" since="#ts-p1"/>
  <when synch="#ts-x1" xml:id="ts-p6"/>
  <when synch="#ts-u1" xml:id="ts-p3" interval="1.5" since="#ts-p6"/>
</timeline>
<u xml:id="ts-u1">This is my <anchor xml:id="ts-x1"/> turn</u></egXML>
Here, the whole of the object with identifier ts-u1 (the utterance) has
been aligned with two different points, ts-p2 and ts-p3.  This is interpreted
to mean that the utterance spans at least those two points.</p>
<p>Finally, a <gi>linkGrp</gi> may be used as an alternative to the
<att>synch</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline origin="#TS-p1" unit="s">
  <when xml:id="TS-p1" absolute="12:20:01"/>
  <when xml:id="TS-p2" interval="4.5" since="#TS-p1"/>
  <when xml:id="TS-p6"/>
  <when xml:id="TS-p3" interval="1.5" since="#TS-p6"/>
</timeline>
<u xml:id="TS-u1">
  <anchor xml:id="TS-u1start"/>
  This is my <anchor xml:id="TS-x1"/> turn
  <anchor xml:id="TS-u1end"/>
</u>
<linkGrp type="synchronous">
  <link targets="#TS-u1start #TS-p1"/>
  <link targets="#TS-u1end #TS-p2"/>
  <link targets="#TS-x1 #TS-p6"/>
</linkGrp></egXML></p>
<p>As a further example of the three possibilities, consider the
following dialogue, represented first as it might appear in a
conventional playscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Tom: I used to smoke - -
Bob: (interrupting) You used to smoke?
Tom: (at the same time) a lot more than this.  But I never
     inhaled the smoke</egXML>
<!-- Atkinson and Heritage (1984) ix-xvi -->
A commonly used convention might be to transcribe such a passage as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">(1) I used to smoke [ a lot more than this ]
(2)                 [ you used to smoke ]
(1) but I never inhaled the smoke</egXML>
Such conventions have the drawback that they are hard to generalize or
to extend beyond the very simple case presented here.  Their reliance on
the accidentals of physical layout may also make them difficult to
transport and to process computationally.  These Guidelines recommend
the following mechanisms to encode this.</p>
<p>Where the whole of one or another utterance is to be synchronized,
the <att>start</att> and <att>end</att> attributes may be used:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#tom">I used to smoke <anchor xml:id="TS-p10"/> a lot more than this
<anchor xml:id="TS-p20"/>but I never inhaled the smoke</u>
<u start="#TS-p10" end="#TS-p20" who="#bob">You used to smoke</u></egXML>
Note that the second utterance above could equally well be encoded as
follows with exactly the same effect:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#bob"><anchor synch="#TS-p10"/>You used to smoke<anchor synch="#TS-p20"/></u></egXML></p>
<p>If synchronization with specific timing information is required, a
<gi>timeline</gi> must be included:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline origin="#TS-t01">
   <when xml:id="TS-t01"/>
   <when xml:id="TS-t02"/>
</timeline>
<u who="#tom">I used to smoke
   <anchor synch="#TS-t01"/>a lot more than this
   <anchor synch="#TS-t02"/>but I never inhaled the smoke</u>
<u who="#bob">       
   <anchor synch="#TS-t01"/>You used to smoke<anchor synch="#TS-t02"/></u></egXML></p>
<p>As above, since the whole of Bob's utterance is to be aligned, the
<att>start</att> and <att>end</att> attributes may be used as an
alternative to the second pair of <gi>anchor</gi> elements:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u start="#TS-t01" end="#TS-t02" who="#bob">You used to smoke</u></egXML></p>
<p>An alternative approach is to mark the synchronization by pointing
from the <gi>timeline</gi> to the text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline origin="#TS-T01">
   <when synch="#TS-nm1 #bob-u2" xml:id="TS-T01"/>
   <when synch="#TS-nm2 #bob-u2" xml:id="TS-T02"/>
</timeline>
<u who="#tom">I used to smoke
   <anchor xml:id="TS-nm1"/>a lot more than this
   <anchor xml:id="TS-nm2"/>but I never inhaled the smoke</u>
<u xml:id="bob-u2" who="#bob">You used to smoke</u></egXML>
To avoid deciding whether to point from the timeline to the text or vice
versa, a <gi>linkGrp</gi> may be used:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body>
  <timeline origin="#T001">
     <when xml:id="T001"/>
     <when xml:id="T002"/>
  </timeline>
  <u who="#tom">I used to smoke
     <anchor xml:id="NM01"/>a lot more than this
     <anchor xml:id="NM02"/>but I never inhaled the smoke</u>
  <u xml:id="bob-U2" who="#bob">You used to smoke</u>
  <linkGrp type="synchronize">
     <link targets="#T001 #NM01 #bob-U2"/>
     <link targets="#T002 #NM02 #bob-U2"/>
  </linkGrp>
</body></egXML></p>
<p>Note that in each case, although Bob's utterance follows Tom's
sequentially in the text, it is aligned temporally with its middle,
without any need to disrupt the normal syntax of the text.</p>
<p>As a final example, consider the following exchange, first as it
might be represented using a musical-score-like notation, in which
points of synchronization are represented by vertical alignment of the
text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">A : This is |my  |turn
B :         |Balderdash
C :         |No, |it's mine</egXML>
All three speakers are simultaneous at the words <mentioned>my</mentioned>,
<mentioned>Balderdash</mentioned>, and <mentioned>No</mentioned>; speakers A and C are
simultaneous at the words <mentioned>turn</mentioned> and <mentioned>it's</mentioned>.
This could be encoded as follows, using pointers from the alignment map
into the text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline origin="#TSp1">
   <when synch="#TSa1 #TSb1 #TSc1" xml:id="TSp1"/>
   <when synch="#TSa2 #TSc2" xml:id="TSp2"/>
</timeline>
<u who="#A">this is <anchor xml:id="TSa1"/> my <anchor xml:id="TSa2"/> turn</u>
<u who="#B">balderdash</u>
<u who="#C"> no <anchor xml:id="TSc2"/> it's mine</u></egXML></p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSREG"><head>Regularization of Word Forms</head>
<p>When speech is transcribed using ordinary orthographic notation, as
is customary, some compromise must be made between the sounds produced
and conventional orthography.  Particularly when dealing with informal,
dialectal or other varieties of language, the transcriber will
frequently have to decide whether a particular sound is to be treated as
a distinct vocabulary item or not.  For example, while in a given
project <mentioned>kinda</mentioned> may not be worth distinguishing as a
vocabulary item from <mentioned>kind of</mentioned>, <mentioned>isn't</mentioned> may
clearly be worth distinguishing from <mentioned>is not</mentioned>; for some
purposes, the regional variant <mentioned>isnae</mentioned> might also be worth
distinguishing in the same way.</p>
<p>One rule of thumb might be to allow such variation only where a
generally accepted orthographic form exists, for example, in published
dictionaries of the language register being encoded; this has the
disadvantage that such dictionaries may not exist.  Another is to
maintain a controlled (but extensible) set of normalized forms for all
such words; this has the advantage of enforcing some degree of
consistency among different transcribers.  Occasionally, as for example
when transcribing abbreviations or acronyms, it may be felt necessary to
depart from conventional spelling to distinguish between cases where the
abbreviation is spelled out letter by letter (e.g.  <mentioned>B B C</mentioned>
or <mentioned>V A T</mentioned>) and where it is pronounced as a single word
(<mentioned>VAT</mentioned> or <mentioned>RADA</mentioned>).  Similar considerations
might apply to pronunciation of foreign words
(e.g. <mentioned>Monsewer</mentioned> vs. <mentioned>Monsieur</mentioned>).</p>
<p>In general, use of punctuation, capitalization, etc., in spoken
transcripts should be carefully controlled.  It is important to
distinguish the transcriber's intuition as to what the punctuation
should be from the marking of prosodic features such as pausing,
intonation, etc.</p>
<p>Whatever practice is adopted, it is essential that it be clearly and
fully documented in the editorial declarations section of the header.
It may also be found helpful to include normalized forms of
non-conventional spellings within the text, using the elements for
simple editorial changes described in section <ptr target="#COED"/> (see
further section <ptr target="#TSTPSM"/>).</p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSTPPR"><head>Prosody</head>
<p>In the absence of conventional punctuation, the marking of prosodic
features assumes paramount importance, since these structure and
organize the spoken message.  Indeed, such prosodic features as points
of primary or secondary stress may be represented by specialized
punctuation marks.  Pauses have already been dealt with in section
<ptr target="#TSBAPA"/>; while tone units (or intonational phrases)
can be indicated by the segmentation tag discussed in section
<ptr target="#TSSASE"/>. The <gi>shift</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#TSSASH"/> 
may also be used to encode some prosodic features, for example where all
that is required is the ability to record shifts in voice quality.</p>
<p>For more detailed work, involving a detailed phonological transcript
including representation of stress and pitch patterns, it is probably
best to maintain the prosodic description in parallel with the
conventional written transcript, rather than attempt to embed detailed
prosodic information within it.  The two parallel streams may be aligned
with each other and with other streams, for example an acoustic
encoding, using the general alignment mechanisms discussed in section
<ptr target="#TSSASH"/>.</p>
<p>Where only a small number of phonetic or phonemic aspects are
included in a transcript, it may be convenient to provide a simple set
of entity declarations for the particular set of features marked.  The
entity references in the text may then be redefined to produce simple
punctuation marks (as in the following example), or as references to
bundles of phonological features, in the same way as is proposed for
part of speech tags (see section <ptr target="#AILA"/>).</p>
<p>In the following example, a small set of prosodic features are
recorded throughout the transcript using a user-defined entity set such
as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[<!ENTITY lf ".">    <!-- low fall intonation -->
<!ENTITY fr ",">    <!-- fall rise intonation -->
<!ENTITY lr "?">    <!-- low rise intonation -->
<!ENTITY rf "!">    <!-- rise fall intonation -->
<!ENTITY trunc "-"> <!-- truncated syllable -->
<!ENTITY long ":">  <!-- lengthened syllable -->]]></egXML>
This set of entity definitions may be included directly within the
document type declaration subset for the file, or more conveniently
along with any other extensions or modifications within the user
extensions file defined by the entity <ident type="pe">extensions-decl</ident>, as discussed in section <ptr target="#STIN"/>.  For convenience of reading on the screen, these entity
declarations will map the mnemonic entity names used in the text below
to a conventional punctuation mark.

also demonstrates the use of the <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>gap</gi>
elements discussed in section <ptr target="#COED"/>.  Where words are so
unclear that only their extent can be recorded, the empty <gi>gap</gi>
element may be used; where the encoder can identify the words but wishes
to record a degree of uncertainty about their accuracy, the
<gi>unclear</gi> element may be used. More flexible and detailed
methods of indicating uncertainty are discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>.</p>
<p>Where a transcript includes many phonetic or phonemic aspects, it
will generally be convenient to use a specialized writing system, as
defined in chapters <ptr target="#CH"/> and <ptr target="#WD"/>. For
representation of phonemic information, the use of the International
Phonetic Alphabet is recommended.</p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TSTPSM"><head>Speech Management</head>
<p>Phenomena of <term>speech management</term> include disfluencies such
as filled and unfilled pauses, interrupted or repeated words,
corrections, and reformulations as well as interactional devices asking
for or providing feedback.  Depending on the importance attached to such
features, transcribers may choose to adopt conventionalized
representations for them (as discussed in section <ptr target="#TSREG"/>
above), or to transcribe them using IPA or some other transcription
system.  To simplify analysis of the lexical features of a speech
transcript, it may be felt useful to <soCalled>tidy away</soCalled> many
of these disfluencies.  Where this policy has been adopted, these
Guidelines recommend the use of the tags for simple editorial
intervention discussed in section <ptr target="#COED"/>, to make explicit
the extent of regularization or normalization performed by the
transcriber.</p>
<p>For example, false starts, repetition, and truncated words might all
be included within a transcript, but marked as editorially deleted, in
the following way:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u><del type="truncation">s</del>see
<del type="repetition">you you</del> you know
<del type="falseStart">it's</del> he's crazy</u></egXML></p>
<p>As previously noted, the <gi>gap</gi> element may be used to mark
points within a transcript where words have been omitted, for example
because they are inaudible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><gap reason="passing
truck" extent="10" unit="syllables"/></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element may be used to mark words which have
been included although the transcriber is unsure of their accuracy:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u>...and then <unclear reason="passing truck">marbled queen</unclear></u></egXML></p>
<p>Where a transcriber is believed to have incorrectly identified a
word, the elements <gi>corr</gi> or <gi>sic</gi> embedded within a
<gi>choice</gi> element may be used to indicate
both the original and a corrected form of it:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<choice><corr>SCSI</corr><sic>skuzzy</sic></choice>
</egXML>
These elements are further discussed in section <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/>.

<div type="div3" xml:id="TSTPAC"><head>Analytic Coding</head>
<p>The recommendations made here only concern the establishment of a
basic text. Where a more sophisticated analysis is needed, more
sophisticated methods of markup will also be appropriate, for example,
using stand-off markup to indicate multiple segmentation of the
stream of discourse, or complex alignment of several segments within it.
Where additional annotations (sometimes called
<soCalled>codes</soCalled> or <soCalled>tags</soCalled>) are used to
represent such features as linguistic word class (noun, verb, etc.),
type of speech act (imperative, concessive, etc.), or information status
(theme/rheme, given/new, active/semi-active/new), etc., a selection from
the general purpose analytic tools discussed in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/>, <ptr target="#AI"/>, and <ptr target="#FS"/>, may be used to
advantage.
