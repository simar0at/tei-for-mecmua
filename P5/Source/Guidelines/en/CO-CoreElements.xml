<head>Elements Available in All TEI Documents</head>
<p>This chapter describes elements which may appear in any kind of text
and the tags used to mark them in all TEI documents. Most of these
elements are freely floating phrases, which can appear at any point
within the textual structure, although they must generally be contained
by a higher-level element of some kind (such as a paragraph). A few of
the elements described in this chapter (for example, bibliographic
citations and lists) have a comparatively well-defined internal
structure, but most of them have no consistent inner structure of their
own. In the general case, they contain only a few words, and are often
identifiable in a conventionally printed text by the use of typographic
conventions such as shifts of font, use of quotation or other
punctuation marks, or other changes in layout.</p>
<p>This chapter begins by describing the <gi>p</gi> tag used to mark
paragraphs, the prototypical formal unit for running text
in many TEI modules. This is followed, in
section <ptr target="#COPU"/>, by a discussion of some specific problems
associated with the interpretation of conventional punctuation, and the
methods proposed by the Guidelines for resolving ambiguities
therein.</p>

<p>The next section (section <ptr target="#COHQ"/>) describes a number
of phrase-level elements commonly marked by typographic features (and
thus well-represented in conventional markup languages). These include
features commonly marked by font shifts (section <ptr target="#COHQH"/>) and features commonly marked by quotation marks
(section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>) as well as such features as terms,
cited words, and glosses (section <ptr target="#COHQU"/>).</p>

<p>Section <ptr target="#COED"/> introduces some phrase-level elements
which may be used to record simple editorial interventions, such as
emendation or correction of the encoded text. The elements described
here constitute a simple subset of the full mechanisms for encoding
such information (described in full in chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>),
which should be adequate to most commonly encountered situations.</p>

<p>The next section (section <ptr target="#CONA"/>) describes several
phrase-level and inter-level elements which, although often of
interest for analysis or processing, are rarely explicitly identified
in conventional printing. These include names (section <ptr target="#CONARS"/>), numbers and measures (section <ptr target="#CONANU"/>), dates and times (section <ptr target="#CONADA"/>), abbreviations (section <ptr target="#CONAAB"/>), and addresses (section <ptr target="#CONAAD"/>).</p>

<p>In the same way, the following section (section <ptr target="#COXR"/>) presents only a subset of the facilities available
for the encoding of cross-references or text-linkage. The full story
may be found in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>; the tags presented here
are intended to be usable for a wide variety of simple
applications.</p>

<p>Sections <ptr target="#COLI"/>, and <ptr target="#CONO"/>, describe
two kinds of quasi-structural elements: lists and notes. These may
appear either within chunk-level elements such as paragraphs, or
between them. Several kinds of lists are catered for, of an arbitrary
complexity. The section on notes discusses both notes found in the
source and simple mechanisms for adding annotations of an interpretive
nature during the encoding; again, only a subset of the facilities
described in full elsewhere (specifically, in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>) is discussed.</p>
<p>Section <ptr target="#COGR"/> introduces some simple ways of
representing graphic or other non-textual content found in a text. A
fuller discussion of the multimedia facilities supported by these
Guidelines may be found in chapters <ptr target="#FT"/> and <ptr target="#SA"/>. </p>
<p>Next, section <ptr target="#CORS"/>, describes methods of
encoding within a text the conventional system or systems used when
making references to the text. Some reference systems have attained
canonical authority and must be recorded to make the text useable in
normal work; in other cases, a convenient reference system must be
created by the creator or analyst of an electronic text.</p>
<p>Like lists and notes, the bibliographic citations discussed in
section <ptr target="#COBI"/>, may be regarded as structural elements in
their own right. A range of possibilities is presented for the encoding
of bibliographic citations or references, which may be treated as
simple phrases within a running text, or as highly-structured
components suitable for inclusion in a bibliographic database.</p>
<p>Additional elements for the encoding of passages of verse or drama
(whether prose or verse) are discussed in section <ptr target="#CODV"/>.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with a technical overview of the structure and
organization of the module described here. This should be read in
conjunction with chapter <ptr target="#ST"/>, describing the structure of
the TEI document type definition.</p> 
<div type="div2" xml:id="COPA"><head>Paragraphs</head>
<p>The paragraph is the fundamental organizational unit for all prose
texts, being the smallest regular unit into which prose can be
divided. Prose can appear in all TEI texts, even those that are
primarily of another genre (e.g., verse); thus the paragraph is
described here, as an element which can appear in any kind of
text.</p>
<p>Paragraphs can contain any of the other elements described within
this chapter, as well as some other elements which are specific to
individual text types. We distinguish <term>phrase-level</term>
elements, which must be entirely contained within a paragraph and
cannot appear except within one, from <term>chunks</term>, which can
appear between, but not within, paragraphs, and from
<term>inter-level</term> elements, which can appear either within a
single paragraph or between paragraphs. The class of phrases includes
emphasized or quoted phrases, names, dates, etc. The class of
inter-level elements includes bibliographic citations, notes, lists,
etc. The class of chunks includes the paragraph itself, and other
elements which have similar structural properties, notably the
<gi>ab</gi> (anonymous block) element described in <ptr target="#SASE"/>) which may be used as an alternative to the paragraph
in some kinds of texts.</p>
<p>Because paragraphs may appear in different base or additional tag
sets, their possible contents may differ in different kinds of
documents. In particular, additional elements not listed in this
chapter may appear in paragraphs in certain kinds of text. However, the
elements described in this chapter are always by default available in
all kinds of text.</p>
<p>The paragraph is marked using the <gi>p</gi> element:
 <specList><specDesc key="p"/></specList></p>
<p>If a consistent internal subdivision of paragraphs is desired, the
<gi>s</gi> or <gi>seg</gi> (<soCalled>segment</soCalled>) elements may
be used, as discussed in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/> and <ptr target="#AI"/>
respectively. More usually, however, paragraphs have no firm internal
structure, but contain prose encoded as a mix of characters, entity
references, phrases marked as described in the rest of this chapter, and
embedded elements like lists, figures, or tables.</p>
<p>Since paragraphs are usually explicitly marked in Western texts,
typically by indentation, the application of the <gi>p</gi> tag
usually presents few problems.</p>
<p>In some cases, the body of a text may comprise but a single
paragraph:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COPA-eg-1"><body>
   <p>I fully appreciate Gen. Pope's splendid achievements with their
invaluable results; but you must know that Major Generalships in the
Regular Army, are not as plenty as blackberries.</p>
</body></egXML>

	<!-- Library of America, Lincoln, v. 2 p. 315.                -->
 </p>
<p>This news story shows typically short journalistic paragraphs:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head>SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 19</head><p>Serbs seized more territory in this struggling new country today as

<p>...</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The following extract from a Russian fairy tale demonstrates
how other phrase level elements (in this case <gi>q</gi> elements
representing direct speech; see section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>)
may be nested within, but not across, paragraphs:

<div type="div2" xml:id="COPU"><head>Treatment of Punctuation</head>

<p>Punctuation marks cause problems for text markup when they are not
available in the character set used and when they are significantly
ambiguous. To a large extent, the availability of the Unicode
character set addresses most such problems, since it provides specific
codepoints for most punctuation marks, and also distinguishes glyphs
(such as stop, comma, and hyphen) which are used with different
functions. Thus, for example,  different Unicode code points
are available for the hyphen used as a minus sign, as a word breaking
hyphen, as a soft hyphen, or as a  <soCalled>non-breaking</soCalled>
hyphen. The facilities described in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/> may
also be used to define markup for non-standard punctuation
characters. </p>

<p><term rend="noindex">Full stop (period)</term><index><term>full
stop</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index><index><term>period</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
may mark (orthographic) sentence boundaries, abbreviations, decimal
points, or serve as a visual aid in printing numbers. These usages can
be distinguished by tagging S-units, abbreviations, and numbers, as
described in sections <ptr target="#SASE"/>, <ptr target="#CONAAB"/>,
and <ptr target="#CONANU"/>. However, there are independent reasons
for tagging these, whether or not they are marked by full
stops, and the polysemy of the full stop itself is perhaps no different from
that of any character in the writing system. </p>

<!--

. Alternatively, entity names like the following might be used to
distinguish stops (and other characters) used for these purposes:
<list type="gloss"><label>stop.abbr </label>
<item>a stop used to end an abbreviation</item><label>stop.sent </label>
<item>a stop used to end a sentence</item><label>stop.abse </label>
<item>a stop used both to end an abbreviation
                        and to end a sentence</item><label>stop.dec  </label>
<item>a stop used as a decimal point</item><label>comma.dec </label>
<item>a comma used as a decimal point</item><label>middot.dec </label>
<item>a midline dot used as a decimal point</item><label>stop.space </label>
<item>a stop used as a numeric space character</item><label>comma.space </label>
<item>a comma used as a numeric space character</item></list>

and <term rend="noindex">exclamation mark</term><index><term>exclamation mark</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
typically mark the end of orthographic sentences, but may also be used
as a mid-sentence comment by the author (<mentioned>!</mentioned> to express
surprise or some other strong feeling, <mentioned>?</mentioned> to query a word
or expression or mark a sentence as dubious in linguistic discussion).
These uses may be distinguished by marking S-units, in which case the
mid-sentence uses of these punctuation marks may be left unmarked, or
tagged using the <gi>c</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#AILC"/>.
 </p>

<p><term rend="noindex">Hyphens</term><index><term>hyphen</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index><index><term>hyphen</term><index><term>soft and hard</term></index></index>
 at line-end may or may not indicate permanent
 (<soCalled>hard</soCalled>) hyphens in the word. Where the lineation
 of the machine-readable text differs from the original, the editor
 may either eliminate non-significant line-end hyphens or replace them by a reference
 to an appropriate character entity.<note place="foot"><ident type="ge">shy</ident> (<soCalled>soft
 hyphen</soCalled>) is defined in the standard public entity
 set <ident type="entset">ISOnum</ident>; Unicode reserves code point
 2010 for the
 hyphen, and 2011 for the <soCalled>non-breaking</soCalled> hyphen.</note>
 Whichever method is adopted, it should be
 reported using the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element within the encoding
 declarations in the TEI header. See chapter <ptr target="#HD" type="div1"/> for discussion of the TEI header and encoding
 declarations.</p> 
<p>When creating a machine-readable text from scratch, it is best not
 to introduce hyphenation simply to make lines of a predefined
 length, since  one cannot then easily tell whether the
 hyphens are soft or hard. When compounds or prefixed words
 are  hyphenated in mid-sentence, it may be impossible to tell whether the
 hyphenation is due to formatting or to linguistic concerns. </p>-->
 <p><term rend="noindex">Dashes</term><index><term>dash</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
 <!-- are best distinguished in form by using the entity names
 provided in the public entity set <ident
 type="entset">ISOpub</ident>, defined in ISO 8879: <ident
 type="ge">mdash</ident>, <ident type="ge">ndash</ident>, and <ident
 type="ge">dash</ident> (the <soCalled>true</soCalled>
 hyphen). Alternatively, in a standalone XML context, these entities
 may be represented as Unicode characters <code>&amp;#x2014;</code>,
 <code>&amp;#x2013;</code>, or <code>&amp;#x2010;</code> respectively.
 Dashes--> are used for a variety of purposes: insertion,
 interruption, new speaker (in dialogue), list item. In the latter two
 cases it is preferable to mark the underlying feature using the
 elements <gi>q</gi> or <gi>item</gi>, on which see section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>, and section <ptr target="#COLI"/>, respectively.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Quotation marks</term><index><term>quotation
marks</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> may be
removed from text contained by 
  <gi>q</gi> or <gi>quote</gi> elements, especially as quotations are not
  always marked by quotation marks (notably long quotations) or may be
  marked in a variety of ways; see the discussion of quotation and
  related features in section <ptr target="#COHQQ"/>.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Apostrophes</term><index><term>apostrophe</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index> must be distinguished from single quote marks. As with hyphens, this disambiguation may be performed by selecting an appropriate Unicode character, but it may also be represented by using explicit XML tags for quotations as suggested above. <!--
 This is best done by tagging quotations or other uses of quotation
 marks (see above). --> However, apostrophes have a variety of uses. In
 English they mark contractions, genitive forms, and (occasionally)
 plural forms. Full disambiguation of these uses belongs to the level
 of linguistic analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p><term rend="noindex">Parentheses</term><index><term>parentheses</term><index><term>functions</term></index></index>
and other marks of suspension such as dashes or ellipses are often
used to signal information about the syntactic structure of a text
fragment. Full disambiguation of their uses also belongs to the level
of linguistic analysis and interpretation, and is therefore discussed
in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>.
</p>
<p>Where punctuation marks are disambiguated by tagging the underlying
feature they signal, it may be debated whether they should be excluded
or left as part of the text. In the case of quotation marks, it may
be more convenient to distinguish opening from closing marks
simply by using the appropriate Unicode character than to use the
<gi>q</gi> element, with or without a <att>rend</att> attribute. The
solution chosen will vary depending upon the feature and depending upon
the purpose of the project.
</p> 
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="COHQ"><head>Highlighting and Quotation</head>
<p>This section deals with a variety of textual features, all of
which have in common that they are frequently realized in conventional
printing practice by the use of such features as underlining, italic
fonts, or quotation marks, collectively referred to here as
<term>highlighting</term>. After an initial discussion of this
phenomenon and alternate approaches to encoding it, this section
describes ways of encoding the following textual features, all
of which are conventionally rendered using some kind of highlighting:
<list type="simple">
<item>emphasis, foreign words and other linguistically distinct uses
of highlighting</item>
<item>representation of speech and thought, quotation, etc.</item>
<item>technical terms, glosses, etc.</item></list>
 </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COHQW"><head>What Is Highlighting?</head>
<p>By <mentioned>highlighting</mentioned> we mean the use of any
combination of<index><term>highlighting</term></index> typographic
features (font, size, hue, etc.) in a printed or written text in order
to distinguish some passage of a text from its surroundings.<note place="foot">Although the way in which a spoken text is performed,
(for example, the voice quality, loudness, etc.)  might be regarded as
analogous to <soCalled>highlighting</soCalled> in this sense, these
Guidelines recommend distinct elements for the encoding of such
<soCalled>highlighting</soCalled> in spoken texts. See further section
<ptr target="#TSSASH"/>.</note> The purpose of highlighting is
generally to draw the reader's attention to some feature or
characteristic of the passage highlighted; this section describes the
elements recommended by these Guidelines for the encoding of such
textual features.
 </p>
<p>In conventionally printed modern texts, highlighting is often
employed to identify words or phrases which are regarded as being one or
more of the following:
<list type="simple">
<item>distinct in some way — as foreign, dialectal,
archaic, technical, etc.</item>
<item>emphatic, and which would for example be stressed when spoken</item>
<item>not part of the body of the text, for example cross references,
titles, headings, labels, etc.</item>
<item>identified with a distinct narrative stream, for example an
internal monologue or commentary.</item>
<item>attributed by the narrator to some other agency, either within the
text or outside it:  for example, direct speech or quotation.</item>
<item>set apart from the text in some other way:  for example,
proverbial phrases, words mentioned but not used, names of persons and
places in older texts, editorial corrections or additions, etc.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>The textual functions indicated by highlighting may not be rendered
consistently in different parts of a text or in different texts. (For
example, a foreign word may appear in italics if the surrounding text is
in roman, but in roman if the surrounding text is in italics.)  For this
reason, these Guidelines distinguish between the encoding of rendering
itself and the encoding of the underlying feature expressed by it.
 </p>
<p>Highlighting as such may be encoded by using either of the global
attributes <att>rend</att> or <att>rendition</att> attributes (see
<ptr target="#STGA"/>).  This allows the encoder both to specify the
function of a highlighted phrase or word, by selecting the appropriate
element described here or elsewhere in the Guidelines, and to further
describe the way in which it is highlighted, by means of the
<att>rend</att> attribute. If the encoder wishes to offer no
interpretation of the feature underlying the use of highlighting in
the source text, then the <gi>hi</gi> element may be used, which
indicates only that the text so tagged was highlighted in some way.
<specList>
<specDesc key="hi"/>
</specList>
The <gi>hi</gi> element is provided by the <ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident> class. </p>
<p>The possible values carried by the <att>rend</att> attribute are not
formally defined in this version of the Guidelines. Since the
<att>rend</att> attribute may be used to document any peculiarity of the
way a given segment of text was rendered in the original source text, it
may need to express a very large range of typographic features, by no
means restricted to type face, type size, etc.
 </p>
<p>Where it is both appropriate and feasible, these Guidelines recommend
that the textual feature marked by the highlighting should be encoded,
rather than just the simple fact of the highlighting. This is for the
following reasons:
<list type="simple">
<item>the same kind of highlighting may be used for different purposes
in different contexts</item>
<item>the same textual function may be highlighted in different ways in
different contexts</item>
<item>for analytic purposes, it is in general more useful to know the
intended function of a highlighted phrase than simply that it is
distinct.</item></list>
 </p>
<p>In many, if not most, cases the underlying function of a
highlighted phrase will be obvious and non-controversial, since the
distinctions indicated by a change of highlighting correspond with
distinctions discussed elsewhere in these Guidelines. The elements
available to record such distinctions are, for the most part, members
of the <ident type="class">model.emphLike</ident> class. This and the
<ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident> class mentioned above
constitute the <ident type="class">model.highlighted</ident> class,
which is a phrase level class. Members of this class may appear
anywhere within paragraph level elements.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two classes is simple, and typified by
the two elements <gi>hi</gi> and <gi>emph</gi>: the former marks
simply that a passage is typographically distinct in some way, while
the latter asserts that a passage is linguistically emphasized for
some purpose. These two properties, though often combined, are not
identical. It should however be recognized, however, that cases do
exist in which it is not economically feasible to mark the underlying
function (e.g. in the preparation of large text corpora), as well as
cases in which it is not intellectually appropriate (as in the
transcription of some older materials, or in the preparation of
material for the study of typographic practice). In such cases, the
<gi>hi</gi> element or some other element from the <ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident> class should be used.
 </p>
<p>Elements which are sometimes realized by typographic distinction but
which are not discussed in this section include <gi>title</gi>
(discussed in section <ptr target="#COBI"/>) and <gi>name</gi> (discussed
in section <ptr target="#CONARS"/>).
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COHQH"><head>Emphasis, Foreign Words, and Unusual Language</head>
<p>This subsection discusses the following elements:
<specList><specDesc key="foreign"/><specDesc key="emph"/><specDesc key="distinct"/></specList>
These elements are all members of the <ident type="class">model.emphLike</ident> class. </p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="COHQHF"><head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head>
<p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the text
should be tagged as such, at least where the fact is indicated in the
text. Where the word or phrase concerned is already distinguished from
the rest of the text by virtue of its function (for example, because
it is a name, a technical term, a quotation, a mentioned word, etc.)
then the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute should be used to
specify additionally that its language distinguishes it from the
surrounding text. Any element in the TEI scheme may take a
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute, which specifies both the writing system
and the language used by its content (see section <ptr target="#CHSH"/> for discussion of this attribute). Where there is no
other applicable element, the element <gi>foreign</gi> may be used to
provide a peg onto which the <att>xml:lang</att> may be attached.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHF-eg-5"><q>Aren't you confusing <foreign xml:lang="la">post hoc</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la">propter hoc</foreign>?</q> said the Bee Master. <q>Wax-moth only succeed when weak bees let them in.</q></egXML>

<lb/>unchanged from that of the conducted sinus beats; and a post-extrasystolic cylce
<lb/>that is less than compensatory.</p></egXML>-->
</p>

<p>The <gi>foreign</gi> element should not be used to represent foreign words
which are mentioned or glossed within the text: for these use the
appropriate element from section <ptr target="#COHQU"/> below. Compare the
following example sentences:

 </div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="COHQHE"><head>Emphatic Words and Phrases</head>
<p>The <gi>emph</gi> element is provided to mark words or phrases which
are <emph>linguistically</emph> emphatic or stressed. Text which is
only typographically <soCalled>emphasized</soCalled> falls into the
class of highlighted text, and may be tagged with the <gi>hi</gi>
element. In printed works, emphasis is generally indicated by devices
such as the use of an italic font, a large typeface, or extra wide letter
spacing; in manuscripts and typescripts, it is usually indicated by the
use of underlining.
As the following examples demonstrate, an encoder may choose whether or
not to make explicit the particular type of rendition associated with
the emphasis by use of the <att>rend</att> attribute. If a source text
consistently renders a particular feature (e.g. emphasis or words in
foreign languages) in a particular way, the rendering associated with
that feature may be described in the TEI header using the
<gi>rendition</gi> element. The <att>rend</att>
attribute may then be used to describe examples which deviate from the
norm. For example, assuming that the TEI Header has defined a default
rendering for the <gi>emph</gi> element, the following encoding would
use it:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-10"><q>Sex, sir, is <emph>purely</emph> a
question of appetite!</q> Tarr exclaimed.</egXML>
<!-- Wyndham Lewis, Tarr (1928), Jupiter ed 1968, p.17 -->
If on the other hand no such default has been defined for the
element, the encoder may specify it informally using the
<att>rend</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-11"><q>What it all comes to is this,</q> he said.
<q><emph rend="italic">What does Christopher
Robin do in the morning nowadays?</emph></q></egXML>
<!-- Milne, House at Pooh Corner (1928), p83 -->
or, if a <gi>rendition</gi> element has been provided in the header
(but not necessarily associated with any other element), the
<att>rendition</att> attribute may be used to point to it:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-12"><l>Here Thou, great <name rend="italics">Anna</name>!
   whom three Realms obey,</l>
<l>Doth sometimes Counsel take —

<!-- Pope, Rape of the Lock (1744) III.8 -->
Further information on the use of the <gi>rendition</gi> element is
provided at <ptr target="#HD57"/>. </p>
<p>The <gi>hi</gi> element is used to mark words or phrases which are
highlighted in some way, but for which identification of the intended
distinction is difficult, controversial, or impossible. It enables an
encoder simply to record the fact of highlighting, possibly describing
it by the use of a <att>rend</att> or <att>rendition</att> attribute, as discussed above,
without however taking a position as to the function of the
highlighting. This may also be useful if the text is to be processed in
two stages:  representing simply typographic distinctions during a first
pass, and then replacing the <gi>hi</gi> elements with more specific elements
in a second pass.
 </p>
<p>Some simple examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-13"><hi rend="gothic">And this Indenture further witnesseth</hi>
that the said <hi rend="italic">Walter Shandy</hi>, merchant,
in consideration of the said intended marriage ...</egXML>

In this example, the first highlighted phrase uses black letter or
gothic print to mimic the appearance of a legal document, and italic to
mark <mentioned>Walter Shandy</mentioned> as a name. In a second pass, the
elements <gi>head</gi> or <gi>label</gi> might be appropriate for the
first use, and the element <gi>name</gi> for the second.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-14">The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could
boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They
often <hi rend="quoted">came down</hi> handsomely, and
Scrooge never did.</egXML>
<!-- Dickens Xmas Carol  p 12 -->
In this example, the phrase <mentioned>came down</mentioned> uses
inverted commas to indicate a play on words.<note place="foot">The
Oxford English Dictionary documents the phrase <mentioned>to come
down</mentioned> in the sense <q>to bring or put down; <hi rend="it">esp.</hi> to lay down money; to make a disbursement</q> as being in use, mostly in colloquial or humorous contexts, from at
least 1700 to the latter half of the 19th century.
	</note>
<!-- a ref to OED would be handy here if you have time to find one -->
In a second pass, the element <gi>soCalled</gi> might be preferred.

<div type="div4" xml:id="COHQHD"><head>Other Linguistically Distinct Material</head>
<p>For some kinds of analysis, it may be desirable to encode the
linguistic distinctiveness of words and phrases with more delicacy than
is allowed by the <gi>foreign</gi> element. The <gi>distinct</gi>
element is provided for this purpose. Its attributes allow for
additional information characterizing the nature of the linguistic
distinction to be made in two distinct ways:  the <att>type</att>
attribute simply assigns a user-defined code of some kind to the word or
phrase which assigns it to some register, sub-language, etc. No
recommendations as to the set of values for this attribute are provided
at this time, as little consensus exists in the field.
 </p>
<p>Alternatively, the remaining three attributes may be used in
combination to place a word or phrase on a three-dimensional scale
sometimes used in descriptive linguistics, as for example in
<ref target="#CO-BIBL-1">Mattheier et al, 1988</ref>. 
The <att>time</att> attribute places a word
<term rend="noindex">diachronically</term>,<index><term>diachronic information</term></index>
for example as archaic, old-fashioned, contemporary, futuristic, etc.;
the <att>space</att> attribute places a word
<term rend="noindex">diatopically</term>,<index><term>diatopic information</term></index>
that is, with respect to a geographical classification, for example as
national, regional, international, etc.; the <att>social</att> attribute
places a word <term rend="noindex">diastatically</term>,<index><term>diastatic information</term></index>
that is, with respect to a social classification, for example as
technical, polite, impolite, restricted, etc. Again, no recommendations
are made for the values of these attributes at this time; the encoder
should provide a description of the scheme used in the appropriate
section of the header (see section <ptr target="#HD5"/>).
 </p>
<p>Examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHD-eg-18">Next morning a boy in that dormitory confided to his
bosom friend, a <distinct type="psSlang">fag</distinct> of

<!-- Kipling, Stalky & Co. (1899), Library ed 1950, p.83) -->

Where more complex (or more rigorous) interpretive analyses of the
associations of a word are required, the more detailed and general
mechanisms described in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/> should be preferred to
these simple characterizations. It may also be preferable to record the
kinds of analysis suggested here by means of the simple annotation
element <gi>note</gi> described in section <ptr target="#CONO"/>, or the

 <div type="div3" xml:id="COHQQ"><head>Quotation</head>

 <p>One form of presentational variation found particularly frequently in
 written and printed texts is the use of quotation marks. As with the
 typographic variations discussed in the preceding section, it is
 generally helpful to separate the encoding of the underlying textual
 feature (for example, a quotation or a piece of direct speech) from the
 encoding of its rendering (for example, the use of a particular style of
 quotation marks).</p>

 <p>This section discusses the following elements, all of which are often
 rendered by the use of quotation marks:
 <specList>
   <specDesc key="q"/>
   <specDesc key="said" atts="direct aloud"/>
   <specDesc key="quote"/>
   <specDesc key="cit"/>
   <specDesc key="mentioned"/>
   <specDesc key="soCalled"/>
 </specList>
The elements <gi>mentioned</gi> and <gi>soCalled</gi> are members of
the class <ident type="class">model.emph</ident>; the <gi>q</gi> and
<gi>said</gi> are members of the class <ident type="class">model.qLike</ident> in their own right, while
<gi>cit</gi> and <gi>quote</gi> are members of <ident type="class">model.quoteLike</ident>, a subclass of <ident type="class">model.qLike</ident>. This class is a subclass of <ident type="class">model.inter</ident>; hence all of these elements are
permitted both within and between paragraph-level elements.</p>

 <p>The most common and important use of quotation marks is, of
 course, to mark <term>quotation</term>, by which we mean simply any
 part of the text attributed by the author or narrator to some agency
 other than the narrative voice. The <gi>q</gi> element may be used if
 no further distinction beyond this is judged necessary. If however it
 is felt necessary to distinguish passages which are in some sense
 external to the work from passages of direct speech or thought, a
 more precise element may be chosen from the list above. Typical
 examples include passages cited from other works, for which the
 element <gi>quote</gi> may be used, and words or phrases spoken or
 thought by people or characters within the current work, for which
 the element <gi>said</gi> may be used. The <gi>soCalled</gi> element
 is used for cases where the author or narrator distances him or
 herself from the words in question without however attributing them
 to any other voice in particular. The <gi>mentioned</gi> element is
 appropriate for a case where a word or phrase is being discussed in
 the body of a text rather than forming part of the text directly.
 </p>
 <p>As noted above, if the distinction among these various reasons why a
 passage is offset from surrounding text cannot be made reliably, or
 is not of interest, then all quoted matter may simply be marked using
 the <gi>q</gi> element. </p>
 <p>Quotation may be indicated in a printed source by changes in type
 face, by special punctuation marks (single or double or angled
 quotes, dashes, etc.) and by layout (indented paragraphs, etc.). If
 these characteristics are of interest, one or other of the global
 <att>rend</att> or <att>rendition</att> attributes discussed in
 section <ptr target="#STGA"/> may be used to record them. </p>
 <p>Quotation marks themselves may, like other punctuation marks, be
 felt for some purposes to be worth retaining within a text, quite
 independently of their description by the <att>rend</att> attribute.
This should generally be done using the appropriate Unicode character,
or, if this is not possible, a
 numeric character reference (see <ptr target="#SG-er"/>). 
</p>
 <p>Alternatively, the encoder may suppress all quotation marks, possibly
 recording their form using some appropriate set of conventions 
in the <att>rend</att> attribute. <!--Where this is
 done, the following list of names (taken from the public entity
 sets <ident type="entset">ISOpub</ident> and <ident type="entset">ISOnum</ident>) may be found useful to describe
 quotation-mark styles common in European and American typesetting:-->

 <!-- J.Lavagnino suggests revisiting the issue of mdash in    -->
 <!-- P4:  perhaps this is too print-centered?  (msm)          -->
Some examples are shown below:
<!-- These may be used in the <att>rend</att> attribute to show how the
 quotation was opened and closed. For example, if the words
 <mentioned>pre</mentioned> and <mentioned>post</mentioned> are used to indicate
 preceding and following punctuation, then the following example would
 describe a conventional American book printed using single quotation
 marks:-->
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#DSHD-eg-30"><said rend="PRE lsquo POST rsquo">Who-e debel

 <!-- Queneau, Exercices de style (1947) p.192 -->
 </p>
<p>As  members of the <ident type="class">att.ascribed</ident> class,
 elements <gi>said</gi> and <gi>q</gi>  share the following attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.ascribed" atts="who"/></specList>
This may be used to make explicit who is speaking:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Adolphe se tourna vers lui :
 <said who="#Adolphe">— Alors, Albert,
 quoi de neuf?</said>
 <said who="#Albert">— Pas grand-chose.</said>
 <said who="#Robert">— Il fait beau,</said>
 dit Robert.
 <!-- .... -->
 <list type="speakers">
   <item xml:id="Adolphe"/>
   <item xml:id="Albert"/>
   <item xml:id="Robert"/>
 </list></egXML>
 <!-- should show QUOTATION declarations for these -->
 The <att>who</att> attribute may be supplied whether
 or not an indication of the speaker is given explicitly in the
 text. It may take the form (as above) of  a
 normalized form of the speaker's name, but its role is to act as a
 pointer to a location elsewhere in the text where data about each
 speaker may be supplied. The most appropriate place to place such
 information is within the <term>participant description</term>
 component of the TEI Header, as further discussed in <ptr target="#CCAHPA"/> but for simple cases like the above, a simple list
 of speakers located in the front or back matter of the text may
 suffice.</p>
 <p>It may also be useful to distinguish
 representations of speech from representations of thought, in modern
 printed texts often indicated by a change of typeface. The
 <att>aloud</att> attribute is provided for this purpose, as in this
 example:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-25"><said aloud="true">Oh yes,</said> said Henry, <said aloud="false">I mean
 Gordon Macrae, for example…</said> <said aloud="false">Jungian
 Analyst with Winebox! That's what you called him, you callous bastard,
 didn't you? Eh? Eh?</said></egXML>
 <!-- N Williams, The Wimbledon Poisoner, p 204 -->
 </p>
 <p>Quoted matter may be embedded within quoted matter, as when one
 speaker reports the speech of another:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-26"><said who="#Wilson">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day
 eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he says:—
 <said who="#WilsonSpaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a
 red-headed man.</said></said>
 <!-- ... -->
 <list type="speakers">
   <item xml:id="Wilson">Wilson</item>
   <item xml:id="WilsonSpaulding">Spaulding reported by Wilson</item>
   <!-- ...-->
 </list></egXML>
 <!-- A C Doyle, Red headed league (but where?) -->
 </p>
 <p>Direct speech nested in this way is treated in the same way as
 elsewhere: a change of rendition may occur, but the same
 element should be used. An encoder may however choose to distinguish
 between direct speech which contains quotations from extra-textual
 matter and direct speech itself, as in the following example:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-27"><p><said>The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,</said> the lama half
 sobbed; and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist
 invocation:-<said>
 <quote>
   <l>To Him the Way — the Law — Apart —</l>
   <l>Whom Maya held beneath her heart</l>
   <l>Ananda's Lord — the Bodhisat</l>
 </quote>
 And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My
 pilgrimage is well begun. And what work! What work!</said>
 </p></egXML> 
 <!-- R.Kipling, Kim, Macmillan, 1917(1901) p9 -->
 </p>
 <p>Quotations from other works are often accompanied by a reference to
 their source. The <gi>cit</gi> element may be used to group together
 the quotation and its associated bibliographic reference, which should
 be encoded using the elements for bibliographic references discussed in
 section <ptr target="#COBI"/>, as in the following example.
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-28"><div xml:id="mm01" type="chapter">

 <!-- G. Eliot, Middlemarch, p 1 -->
 <!-- apostrophe added to "Maid's" as per J. Lav, who says     -->
 <!-- Penguin has it. (msm)                                    -->
 Like other bibliographic references, the citation attached to a
 quotation may be represented simply by a pointer, as in this example:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-29">Lexicography has shown little sign of being affected by the
 work of followers of J.R. Firth, probably best summarized
 in his slogan, <cit>

 <ref>(Firth, 1957)</ref>
 </cit></egXML>
 <!-- Hanks, in Looking Up, ed Sinclair, (1987) p.121 -->
 Unlike most of the other elements discussed in this chapter, direct
 speech and quotations may frequently contain other high-level elements
 such as paragraphs or verse lines, as well as being themselves contained
 by such elements. Three possible solutions exist for this well-known
 structural problem:
 <list type="simple">
   <item>the quotation is broken into segments, each of which is
   entirely contained within a paragraph</item>
   <item>the quotation is marked up using stand-off markup</item>
   <item>the quotation boundaries are represented by empty
   segment boundary delimiter elements</item>
 </list>
 For further discussion and several examples, see chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.</p>
 <p>Finally, in this section, the element <gi>soCalled</gi> is provided
 for all cases in which quotation marks are used to distance the quoted
 text from the narrator or speaker. Common examples include the
 <soCalled>scare</soCalled> quotes often found in newspaper headlines and
 advertising copy, where the effect is to cast doubts on the veracity of
 an assertion:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-30"><head>PM dodges <soCalled>election threat</soCalled> in interview</head></egXML>
 <!-- The Guardian, p2, 26 Oct 1992  --></p>
 <p>The same element should be used to mark a variety of special ironic
 usages. Some further examples follow:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">He hated <soCalled>good</soCalled> books.</egXML>
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><soCalled>Croissants</soCalled> indeed! toast not good enough for you?</egXML>
 <!-- some "real" examples would be better -->
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQQ-eg-33">Although Chomsky's decision that all NL
 sentences are finite objects was never justified by arguments from

 <mentioned>language</mentioned> is necessarily restricted to finite

<div type="div3" xml:id="COHQU"><head>Terms, Glosses, Equivalents, and Descriptions</head>
<p>This section describes a set of textual elements which are
used to provide a gloss, alternate identification, or description of
something.</p>
<p>Technical terms are often italicized or emboldened upon first mention
in printed texts; an explanation or gloss is sometimes given in
quotation marks.  Linguistic analyses conventionally cite words in
languages under discussion in italics, providing a gloss immediately
following marked with single quotation marks.  Other texts in which
individual words or phrases are <term rend="noindex">mentioned</term> (for<index><term>mention</term><index><term>vs. use</term></index></index><index><term>use</term><index><term>vs. mention</term></index></index>
example, as examples) rather than <term rend="noindex">used</term> may
mark them either with italics or with quotation marks, and will gloss
them less regularly.<specList>
        <specDesc key="term"/>
	<specDesc key="gloss"/>
</specList>
These elements are also members of
the class <ident type="class">model.emph</ident>.
</p>
<p>A <gi>term</gi> may appear with or without a gloss, as may a
<gi>mentioned</gi> element.  Where the <gi>gloss</gi> is present, it may
be linked to the term it is glossing by means of its <att>target</att>
attribute. To establish such a link, the encoder should give an
<att>xml:id</att> value to the <gi>term</gi> or <gi>mentioned</gi> element
and provide that id as the value of the <att>target</att> attribute on
the <gi>gloss</gi> element.  The following examples demonstrate this
facility:  for more discussion of this and other kinds of linkage within
TEI documents, see chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.
 </p>
<p>Examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQU-eg-42">We may define <term xml:id="TDPv" rend="sc">discoursal point of view</term>
as <gloss target="#TDPv">the relationship, expressed through discourse

and the fiction.</gloss></egXML>
<!-- Leech, Style in Fiction, (1981) p272 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQU-eg-43"><gloss rend="unmarked" target="#PRSR">A computational device that infers

<!-- Sapir, Language (HBJ paperback), p. 79                        -->
 </p>

<p>Another group of elements is used to supply different kinds of names
for objects described by the TEI. Examples of this are documentation
of elements, attributes, classes (and also attribute values where
appropriate), and description of glyphs.
<specList>
<specDesc key="altIdent"/>
<specDesc key="desc"/>
<specDesc key="equiv" atts="uri filter name"/>
</specList>
Along with the <gi>gloss</gi> element mentioned above, these elements
constitute the <ident type="class">model.glossLike</ident> class.</p>

<p>The <gi>gloss</gi> element may be used to
provide  a brief explanation for the name of the object if this is not
self-explanatory. For example, the specification for the element 
<gi>ab</gi> used to mark arbitrary blocks of text begins as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="linking" ident="ab">
  <gloss>anonymous block</gloss>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec></egXML>
A <gi>gloss</gi> 
may also be supplied for an attribute name or an
attribute value in similar circumstances:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valList type="open">
<valItem ident="susp">
<gloss>suspension</gloss>
<desc>the abbreviation provides the first letter(s) 
of the word or phrase, omitting the remainder.</desc>
</valItem>
<valItem ident="contr">
<gloss>contraction</gloss>
<desc>the abbreviation omits some letter(s) in the middle.</desc>
</valItem>
<!--...-->
</valList></egXML>
Note that this is quite distinct from the use of the <gi>desc</gi>
element, which contains a full description of the intended semantics
for the object.
</p>

<p>The <gi>equiv</gi> element is used to document equivalencies
between the concept represented by this object and the same concept as
described in other schemes or ontologies. The <att>uri</att> attribute
is used to supply a pointer to some location where such external
concepts are defined. For example, to indicate that the TEI
<gi>death</gi> element corresponds to the concept defined by the CIDOC
CRM category E69, the declaration for the former might begin as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<elementSpec module="namesdates" ident="death">
<equiv name="E69" uri="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/"/>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>equiv</gi> element may also be used to map newly-defined
elements onto existing constructs in the TEI, using the
<att>filter</att> and <att>name</att> attributes to point to an
implementation of the mapping. This is useful when a TEI customization
(see <ptr target="#MD"/>) defines <soCalled>shortcuts</soCalled> for
convenience of data entry or markup readability.  For example, suppose
that in some TEI customization an element <gi scheme="imaginary">bo</gi> has been
defined which is 
conceptually equivalent to the standard markup construct <tag>hi
rend='bold'</tag>. The following declarations would additionally
indicate that instances of the
<gi scheme="imaginary">bo</gi> element can be converted to canonical TEI by obtaining a
filter from the URI specified, and running the procedure
with the name  <ident>bold</ident>. The <att>mimeType</att> attribute
specifies the language (in this case XSL) in which the filter is
written:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<elementSpec ident="bo" ns="http://www.example.org/ns/notTEI">
   <equiv filter="http://www.example.com/equiv-filter.xsl" mimeType="text/xsl" name="bold"/>
   <gloss>bold</gloss>
   <desc>contains a sequence of characters rendered in a bold face.</desc>
   <!-- ... -->
</elementSpec>
</egXML></p>

<p>The <gi>altIdent</gi> element is used to provide an alternative name
for an object, for example using a different
natural language. Thus, the following might be used to indicate
that the <gi>abbr</gi> element should be identified using the German
word <foreign>Abkürzung</foreign>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec ident="abbr" mode="change">

<!--...--></elementSpec></egXML>
In the same way, the following specification for the
<gi>graphic</gi> element indicates that the attribute
<att>url</att> may also be referred to using the alternate
identifier <ident>href</ident>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec ident="graphic" mode="change">
    <attList>
      <attDef mode="change" ident="url">
	<altIdent>href</altIdent>
      </attDef>
<!-- .... -->
    </attList>
</elementSpec>
</egXML>
</p><p>By default, the <gi>altIdent</gi> of a component is
identical to the value of its <att>ident</att> attribute. </p>

<p>The contents of the <gi>desc</gi> element provide a brief
characterization of the intended function of the object
being documented in a form that permits its quotation out of
context, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="core" ident="foreign">
<!--... -->
<desc>identifies a word or phrase as belonging to some language other
than that of the surrounding text. </desc>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec></egXML>
By convention, a <gi>desc</gi> element begins with a verb such as
<mentioned>contains</mentioned>, 
<mentioned>indicates</mentioned>, 
<mentioned>specifies</mentioned>, etc. and contains a single
clause. </p>

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COHQHEG"><head>Some Further Examples</head>
<p>As a simple example of the elements discussed here, consider the
following sentence:
<q rend="display">On the one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title> 
is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century
France, the <foreign>romans d'antiquité</foreign>,
the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, and the German
adaptations of these works by Heinrich van Veldeke,
Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q>
A first approximation to the encoding of this sentence might be simply
to record the fact that the phrases printed above in italics are
highlighted, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONADA-eg-144">On the one hand the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is
associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
the <hi xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">romans d'antiquité</hi>,
the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, ...</egXML>
This encoding would, however, lose the important distinction between
an italicized title and an italicized foreign phrase.  Many other
phrases might also be italicized in the text, and a retrieval
program seeking to identify foreign terms (for example) would not
be able to produce reliable results by simply looking for italicized
words.  Where economic and intellectual constraints permit, therefore,
it would be preferable to encode both the function of the
highlighted phrases and their appearance, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">On the one hand the <title rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</title>
is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
the <foreign rend="italic">romans d'antiquité</foreign>, the
romances of Chrétien de Troyes, ...</egXML></p>
<p>In this example, the decision as to which textual features
are distinguished by the highlighting is relatively
uncontroversial.  As a less straightforward example, consider the
use of italic font in the following passage:
<q rend="display">A pretty common case, I believe; in all
<hi rend="it">vehement</hi> debatings.  She says I am
<hi rend="it">too witty</hi>; Anglicé,
<hi rend="it">too pert</hi>; I, that she is
<hi rend="it">too wise</hi>; that is to say, being
likewise put into English, <hi rend="it">not so young as
she has been</hi>:  in short, she is grown so much into
a <hi rend="it">mother</hi>, that she had forgotten
she ever was a <hi rend="it">daughter</hi>. ...</q>
 </p>
<p>Clearly, the word <mentioned>vehement</mentioned> is not italicized for the
same reason as the phrase <mentioned>not so young as she has been</mentioned>;
the former is emphasized, while the latter is proverbial.  It also
provides an ironic gloss for the words <mentioned>too wise</mentioned>, in the
same way as <mentioned>too pert</mentioned> glosses <mentioned>too witty</mentioned>.
The glossed phrases are not, however, technical terms or cited words, but
quoted phrases, as if the writer were putting words into her own and her
mother's mouths.  Finally, the words <mentioned>mother</mentioned> and
<mentioned>daughter</mentioned> are apparently italicized simply to oppose them
in the sentence; certainly they do not fit into any of the categories so
far proposed as reasons for italicizing.  Note also that the word
<mentioned>Anglicé</mentioned> is not italicized although it is not
generally considered an English word.
 </p>
<p>The following sample encoding for the above passage attempts to take
into account all the above points:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHEG-eg-02">A pretty common case, I believe; in all <emph>vehement</emph>
debatings. She says I am <q rend="italic">too witty</q>;
<foreign xml:lang="la" rend="roman">Anglicé</foreign>,
<gloss rend="italic">too pert</gloss>; I, that she is
<q rend="italic"> too wise</q>; that is to say, being likewise
put into English, <gloss rend="italic">not so young as she has
been</gloss>: in short, she is grown so much into a
<hi rend="italic">mother</hi>, that she had forgotten she ever
was a <hi rend="italic">daughter</hi>.</egXML>
<!-- WWP proofer points out inconsistency between tagging     -->
	<!-- and commentary.  "too witty" and "too wise" retagged     -->

<div type="div2" xml:id="COED"><head>Simple Editorial Changes</head>
<p>As in editing a printed text, so in encoding a text in electronic
form, it may be necessary to accommodate editorial comment on the text
and to render account of any changes made to the text in preparing it.
The tags described in this section may be used to record such editorial
interventions, whether made by the encoder, by the editor of a printed
edition used as a copy text, by earlier editors, or by the copyists of
manuscripts.</p>

<p>The tags described here handle most common types of editorial
intervention and stereotyped comment; where less structured commentary
of other types is to be included, it should be marked using the
<gi>note</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#CONO"/>.
Systematic interpretive annotation is also possible using the various
methods described in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>. The examples given
here illustrate only simple cases of editorial intervention; in
particular, they permit economical encoding of a simple set of
alternative readings of a short span of text. To encode multiple views
of large or heterogenous spans of text, the mechanisms described in
chapter <ptr target="#SA"/> should be used. To encode multiple
witnesses of a particular text, a similar mechanism designed
specifically for critical editions is described in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>.</p>

<p>For most of the elements discussed here, some encoders may wish to
indicate both a <term>responsibility</term>, that is, a code
indicating the person or agency responsible for making the editorial
intervention in question, and also an indication of the degree of
<term>certainty</term> which the encoder wishes to associate with the
intervention. Because these requirements are common to many of the
elements discussed in this section, they are provided by an attribute
class, called <ident type="class">att.editLike</ident>. All members of
this class carry the following optional attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.editLike" atts="cert resp evidence"/></specList>
</p>

<p>Many of the elements discussed here can be used in two ways. Their
primary purpose is to indicate that the text encoded as the element's
content represents an editorial intervention (or non-intervention) of
a specific kind, indicated by the element itself. However, pairs or
other meaningful groupings of such elements can also be supplied,
wrapped within a special purpose <gi>choice</gi> element:
  <specList>
  <specDesc key="choice"/>
</specList>
This element enables the encoder to represent for example a text in
its <soCalled>original</soCalled> uncorrected and unaltered form,
alongside the same text in one or more <soCalled>edited</soCalled>
forms. This usage permits software to switch automatically between one
<soCalled>view</soCalled> of a text and another, so that (for example)
a stylesheet may be set to display either the text in its original
form or after the application of editorial interventions of particular
kinds.</p>
<p>Elements which can be combined in this way constitute the
<ident type="class">model.choicePart</ident> class. The default
members of this class are  <gi>sic</gi>,
<gi>corr</gi>, <gi>reg</gi>, <gi>orig</gi>, <gi>unclear</gi>,
<gi>add</gi>, and <gi>del</gi>; their functions and usage are
described further below.</p>
<p>Three categories of editorial intervention are discussed in this
section:
<list type="simple">
<item>indication or correction of apparent errors </item>
<item>indication or regularization of variant, irregular,
non-standard, or eccentric forms</item>
<item>editorial additions, suppressions, and
omissions</item></list></p>
<p>A more extended treatment of the use of these tags in
transcriptional and editorial work is given in chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COEDCOR"><head>Apparent Errors</head>
<p>When the copy text is manifestly faulty, an encoder or transcriber
may elect simply to correct it without comment, although for scholarly
purposes it will often be more generally useful to record both the
correction and the original state of the text. The elements described
here enable all three approaches, and allows the last to be done is
such a way as make it easy for software to present
either the original or the correction. 
<specList>
  <specDesc key="sic"/>
  <specDesc key="corr"/>
</specList>
 </p><p>The following examples show alternative treatment of the same
material. The copy text reads:
<q rend="display">Another property of computer-assisted historical
research is that data modelling must permit any one textual feature or
part of a textual feature to be a part of more than one information
model and to allow the researcher to draw on several such models
simultaneously, for example, to select from a machine-readable text
those marginal comments which indicate that the date's mentioned in the
main body of the text are incorrect.</q></p>
<p>An encoder may choose to correct the typographic error, either
silently or with an indication that a correction has been made, as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the <corr>dates</corr>
mentioned in the main body of the text are incorrect.</egXML></p><p>Alternatively, the encoder may simply record the typographic
error without correcting it, either without comment or with a
<gi>sic</gi> element to indicate the error is not a transcription error
in the encoding:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the <sic>date's</sic>
mentioned in the main body of the text are incorrect.</egXML></p><p>If the encoder elects both to record the original source text
and to provide a correction for the sake of word-search
and other programs, both <gi>sic</gi> and <gi>corr</gi> are used,
wrapped in a <gi>choice</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the
  <choice>
    <corr>dates</corr>
    <sic>date's</sic>
  </choice> mentioned in the main body of the text are
  incorrect.</egXML>The <gi>sic</gi> and <gi>corr</gi> elements can
  appear in either order.</p>
<p>If  it is desired to indicate the person or edition responsible for
the emendation, this might be done as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">… marginal comments which indicate that the
  <choice>
    <corr resp="#msm">dates</corr>
    <sic>date's</sic>
  </choice> mentioned in the main body of the text are
  incorrect.
<!-- within the header for this document ... -->
<respStmt>
<resp>editor</resp>
<name xml:id="msm">C.M. Sperberg McQueen</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>Here the <att>resp</att> attribute
has been used to indicate responsibility for the correction. Its value (<val>#msm</val>) is an example of the <term>pointer</term> values discussed
  in section <ptr target="#COXR"/>; in this case, it points to a
  <gi>name</gi> element within the TEI Header, but any element might be
  indicated in this way, including for example a <gi>person</gi>
  element (if the module described in <ptr target="#ND"/> has been
  included), or one of the bibliographic elements described in <ptr target="#COBI"/>, if the correction has been taken from some other
  source. The <att>resp</att> attribute is
  available for all elements which are part of the <ident type="class">att.editLike</ident> class. The same
  class makes available a  <att>cert</att> attribute,which may be used
  to indicate the degree of editorial
confidence in a particular correction, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COEDCOR-eg-64">An <choice><corr cert="high">Autumn</corr><sic>Antony</sic></choice> it was,
That grew the more by reaping</egXML>
<!-- Antony and Cleopatra, Act 5, scene 2 -->
See further the discussion in section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>.</p>
<p>Where, as here,  the correction takes the form of adding text not otherwise
present in the text being encoded, the encoder
should use the <gi>corr</gi> element. Where the correction is present
in the text being encoded, and consists of some combination of visible
additions and deletions, the elements <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi>
should be used: see further section <ptr target="#COEDADD"/>
below. Where the correction takes the form of addition of material not
present in the original because of physical damage or illegibility,
the <gi>supplied</gi> element may be used. Where the
<soCalled>correction</soCalled> is simply a matter of 
expanding an abbreviation the <gi>ex</gi> element may be used. These
and other elements to support the detailed encoding of  authorial or scribal
interventions of this kind are all provided by the module described in
chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>.

<div type="div3" xml:id="COEDADD"><head>Additions, Deletions, and Omissions</head>
<p>The following elements are used to indicate when words or phrases
have been omitted from, added to, or marked for deletion from, a text.
Like the other editorial elements, they allow for a wide range of
editorial practices: 
<specList>
  <specDesc key="gap" atts="reason"/>
  <specDesc key="unclear" atts="reason"/>
  <specDesc key="add"/>
  <specDesc key="del"/>
</specList></p>



<p>Encoders may choose to omit parts of the copy text for reasons
ranging from illegibility of the source or impossibility of transcribing
it, to editorial policy, e.g. a systematic exclusion of poetry or prose
from an encoding. The full details of the policy decisions concerned
should be documented in the TEI Header (see section <ptr target="#HD5"/>).
Each place in the text at which omission has taken place should be
marked with a <gi>gap</gi> element, with optionally further information
about the reason for the omission, its extent, and the person or agency
responsible for it, as in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><gap reason="illegible" unit="words" extent="2"/></egXML><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><gap reason="overwriting illegible" extent="8" unit="chars"/></egXML></p>

</p> 
<p>The <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements may be used to record
where words or phrases have been added or deleted in the copy text.
They are not appropriate where longer passages have been added or
deleted, which span several elements; for these, the elements
<gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> described in
chapter <ptr target="#PHAD"/> must be used.</p>
<p>Additions to a text may be recorded for a number of reasons.
Sometimes they are marked in a distinctive way in the source text, for
example by brackets or insertion above the line (<term rend="noindex">supralinear</term> insertion),<index><term>additions</term><index><term>supralinear</term></index></index><index><term>insertions</term><index><term>supralinear</term></index></index><index><term>supralinear insertions</term></index> as in

<!-- Mrs Gaskell, The Grey Woman, MS --></p><p>The <gi>add</gi> element should not be used to mark editorial
changes, such as supplying a word omitted by mistake from the source
text or a passage present in another version. In these cases, either
the <gi>corr</gi> or <gi>supplied</gi> tags should be used, as
discussed above in section <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/>, and in section
<ptr target="#PHCC"/>, respectively.</p><p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element is used to mark passages in the
original which cannot be read with confidence, or about which the
transcriber is uncertain for other reasons, as for example when
transcribing a partially inaudible or illegible source. Its
<att>reason</att> and <att>resp</att> attributes are used, as with the
<gi>gap</gi> element, to indicate the cause of uncertainty and the
person responsible for the conjectured reading.</p><p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COEDADD-eg-85"><l>And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald</l>

</p>
<!--
<p>Where there is doubt about the reading of the material affected,
the <att>cert</att> attribute may be used to indicate a degree of
confidence in the reading provided as the content of
<gi>unclear</gi>. 
In cases where the reading of an unclear passage is ambiguous, the
various possible readings can be simultaneously encoded using the
<soCalled>choice</soCalled> mechanism. Simultaneously, the
<att>cert</att> attribute may be used to indicate differing degrees of
confidence about the variant readings.

<!--Need better, preferably believable if not real, example:-->
<!--The following fictitious
example is illustrative, although in this case it is easy to verify
the correct reading from other witnesses.

<p>Where the material affected is entirely illegible or inaudible, the
<gi>gap</gi> element discussed above should be used in preference.</p>
<p>The <gi>del</gi> element is used to mark material which is deleted in
the source but which can still be read with some degree of confidence,
as opposed to material which has been omitted by the encoder or
transcriber either because it is entirely illegible or for some other
reason.  This is of particular importance in transcribing manuscript
material, though deletion is also found in printed texts, sometimes for
humorous purposes:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-01"><l>One day I will sojourn to your shores</l>

<l>Inlets.</l></egXML> 
</p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish different
methods of deletion in manuscript or typescript material, as in this
line from the typescript of Eliot's <title>Waste Land</title>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l><del type="overtyped">Mein</del> Frisch
<del type="overstrike">schwebt</del> weht der Wind</l></egXML></p>
<p>Deletion in manuscript or typescript is often associated with

The <gi>subst</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#PHSU"/> provides
a way of grouping additions and deletions of this kind. </p>
<p>The <gi>del</gi> element should not be used where the deletion is
such that material cannot be read with confidence, or read at all, or
where the material has been omitted by the transcriber or editor for
some other reason. Where the material deleted cannot be read with
confidence, the <gi>unclear</gi> tag should be used with the
<att>reason</att> attribute indicating that the difficulty of
transcription is due to deletion. Where material has been omitted by
the transcriber or editor, this may be indicated by use of the
 <gi>gap</gi> element. <!-- Observe
that the distinction between recommended uses of the <gi>del</gi>,
<gi>corr</gi>, and <gi>gap</gi> tags parallels the distinction drawn
between the <gi>add</gi>, <gi>corr</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi> tags in
section <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/> and section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>:
<list type="simple">
<item>where the correction is a deletion by a scribe or author in a
manuscript or other primary source (typescript, proof, galley, etc.)
then either <gi>corr</gi> (or <gi>sic</gi>) or <gi>del</gi> might be
appropriate, depending on the circumstances. The <gi>del</gi> tag is
more expressive, and may convey information on just how the deletion
was performed (hand, place, etc.) which the <gi>corr</gi> tag cannot.
See further the discussion in section <ptr target="#PHSU"/>.
 </item>
<item>where the correction is a deletion by a transcriber or editor,
correcting a perceived superfluity in the text but in circumstances
where there is no clearly assertable reason for the superfluity (as a
spurious addition) the <gi>corr</gi> tag should be used. The
<gi>del</gi> tag should not be used in this case.
 </item>
<item>where the correction is a deletion by a transcriber or editor,
correcting a perceived superfluity in the text where there is a
clearly assertable reason for the superfluity (as a spurious
addition) the <gi>gap</gi> tag should be used with the
<att>reason</att> attribute carrying the reason for the superfluity
and hence the deletion of text. Neither the <gi>del</gi> nor
<gi>corr</gi> tag should be used in these cases.</item></list>

<div type="div2" xml:id="CONA"><head>Names, Numbers, Dates, Abbreviations, and Addresses</head>

<p>This section describes a number of textual features which it is
often convenient to distinguish from their surrounding text.  Names,
dates, and numbers are likely to be of particular importance to the
scholar treating a text as source for a database; distinguishing such
items from the surrounding text is however equally important to the
scholar primarily interested in lexis.</p>

<p>The treatment of these textual features proposed here is not
intended to be exhaustive: fuller treatments for names, numbers,
measures, and dates are provided in the
names and dates module (see chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>).</p>

<div type="div3" xml:id="CONARS"><head>Referring Strings</head>
<p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some
person, place, object, etc. Two elements are provided to mark such
strings:
<specList>
<specDesc key="rs"/>
<specDesc key="name"/>
</specList>
Where it is thought useful to do so, the kind of object referred to may
be specified using the <att>type</att> attribute.
 </p>

<p>Examples include:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-101"><p><q>My dear 
<rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs></q>, said his lady to 
him one day, <q>have you heard that <rs type="place">
Netherfield Park</rs> is let at last?</q></p></egXML>

<!-- Austen Pride and Prejudice, chap 1 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-102"><p>Collectors of water-rents were appointed by the
<rs type="organization">Watering Committee</rs>.
They were paid a commission not exceeding four per
cent, and gave bond.</p></egXML>
<!-- Allinson and Penrose, Philadelphia 1681-1887, p138 -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-103"><p>It being one of the principles of the
<rs type="org">Circumlocution Office</rs> never, on any
account whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer,
<rs type="person">Mr Barnacle</rs> said, <q>Possibly.</q></p></egXML>
<!-- Little Dorrit, peng ed, p 153 -->
</p><p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be used
for any reference to a person, place, etc., not only to references in
the form of a proper noun or noun phrase.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs></q>, said
<rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day ... </p></egXML>
</p><p>The <gi>name</gi> element by contrast is provided for the special
case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may
be used synonymously with the <gi>rs</gi> element, or nested within it
if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper nouns.
The following example shows an alternative way of encoding the short
sentence from <title>Pride and Prejudice</title> quoted above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>My dear <name type="person">Mr. Bennet</name>,</q> said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day,  
<q>have you heard that <name type="place">Netherfield Park</name> is let at last?</q></p></egXML>
As the following example shows,  a proper name may be nested within a
referring string:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-106"><rs>His Excellency the Life President, <name>Ngwazi Dr H. Kamuzu Banda</name></rs></egXML>
<!-- any issue of the Malawi Daily Times -->
 </p>
<p>Simply tagging something as a name is generally not enough to
enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms
usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the
text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague.  Moreover, name
prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de
la</mentioned> may or may not be included as part of the reference
form of a name, depending on the language and country of origin of the
bearer. </p>

<p>Two issues arise in this context: firstly, there may be a
need to encode a regularised form of a name, distinct from the actual
form in the source to hand; secondly, there may be a need to
identify the particular person, place, etc. referred to by the name,
irrespective of whether the name itself is normalized or not. The
element <gi>reg</gi>, introduced in <ptr target="#COEDREG"/> is provided for
the former purpose; the attribute <att>key</att> for the latter.</p>

<p>The <att>key</att> attribute is common to all members of the
<ident type="class">att.naming</ident> class and is defined as follows:
<specList><specDesc key="att.naming" atts="key"/></specList>
 </p>

<p>Its main use is as a means of gathering together all references to
the same individual or location scattered throughout a document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>My dear <rs key="BENM1" type="person"> Mr. Bennet</rs>,</q> 
said <rs key="BENM2" type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day, 
<q>have you heard that <rs key="NETP1" type="place">Netherfield
Park</rs>  is let at last?</q></p></egXML>

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-108">
<p><name key="VOM1" type="person">Mme. de Volanges</name> marie <rs key="VOM2">sa fille</rs>: c'est encore un secret;
mais elle m'en a fait part hier.</p></egXML>
<!-- de Laclos: Les Liaisons dangereuses, 1963, p.13 -->
</p>

<p>The value of the <att>key</att> attribute may be an unexpanded code, as
in the examples above, with no significance. More usually however, it
will reference  some other resource providing more information about
the entity named by the element, which might itself include a number of
alternative forms of name for the entity in question. </p>


<p>This use should be distinguished from the use of a nested
<gi>reg</gi> (regularization) element to provide the standard form
of a referring string, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-109"><p>My personal life during
the administration of <rs key="POJA1" type="person">Col. Polk
(<reg>Polk, James K.</reg>)</rs> has but poorly compensated me for the
suspended enjoyments and pursuits of private and professional
spheres</p></egXML>
<!-- From the papers of George Mifflin Dallas, cited in -->
	<!-- Philadelphia: A 300 Year History, p349 -->
</p>

<p>The <gi>choice</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#COED"/> may be
used if it is desired to record both a normalized form of a name and
the name used in the source being encoded: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-110"><p><name key="WADLM1" type="person"><choice>
<orig>Walter de la Mare</orig>
<reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg>
</choice></name>
was born at <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in
<name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</p></egXML>
<!-- Frank Swinnerton, The Georgian Literary Scene, 1938, p. 195 -->
</p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#CONOIX"/> may be
more appropriate if the function of the regularization is to provide a
consistent index:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONARS-eg-111"><p><name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a large parish.
At the time of the events which led to
<name type="person">Fournier<index><term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques Fournier)</term></index></name>'s 
investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250 inhabitants.</p></egXML>
<!-- E.L Ladurie: Montaillou, Penguin 1980, p3 -->
	<!-- but should we quote the French? (LB) -->

 Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have
 two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its
 regularised form must be repeated many times; and the burden of
 additional XML markup in the body of the text may be inconvenient to
 maintain and complex to process. For applications such as onomastics,
 relating to persons or places named rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed
analysis of the component parts of a name is needed, the specialized
elements described in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> or the analytical
tools described in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/> should be used.

<div type="div3" xml:id="CONAAD"><head>Addresses</head>

<p>These Guidelines propose the following elements to distinguish
postal and electronic addresses: 
<specList>
<specDesc key="address"/>
<specDesc key="email"/>
</specList>
These two elements constitute the class of
<ident type="class">model.addressLike</ident> elements; for other kinds of address
this class may be extended by adding new elements if necessary. </p>
<p>These Guidelines provide no particular means for encoding the
substructure of an email address (for example, distinguishing the
local part from the domain part), nor of distinguishing personal email
addresses from generic or fictitious ones. 

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<email>editors@tei-c.org</email>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>The simplest way of encoding a postal address is to regard it as a series
of distinct lines, just as they might be written on an envelope. The
following element supports this view:
<specList><specDesc key="addrLine"/></specList>
Here is an example of a postal address encoded using this approach:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <addrLine>110 Southmoor Road,</addrLine>
   <addrLine>Oxford OX2 6RB,</addrLine>
   <addrLine>UK</addrLine>
</address></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Alternatively, an address may be encoded as a structure of
more semantically rich elements. The class <ident type="class">model.addrPart</ident> element class identifies a number
of such possible components: <specList><specDesc key="street"/><specDesc key="name" atts="type"/><specDesc key="postCode"/><specDesc key="postBox"/>
<specDesc key="model.nameLike"/>
<specDesc key="model.persNamePart"/>
<specDesc key="model.placeNamePart"/>
</specList> Any number of
elements from the <ident type="class">model.addrPart</ident> class may
appear within an address and in any order. None of them is
required. </p>

<p>Where code letters are commonly used in addresses (for
example, to identify regions or countries) a useful practice is to
supply the full name of the region or country as the content of the
element, but to supply the abbreviatory code as the value of the
global <att>n</att> attribute, so that (for example) an application
preparing formatted labels can readily find the required
information. Other components of addresses may be represented using
the general-purpose <gi>name</gi> element or (when the additional
module for names and dates is included) the more specialized  elements
provided for that purpose.
</p>

<p>Using just the elements defined by the core module, the above
address could thus be represented as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <street>110 Southmoor Road</street>
   <name type="city">Oxford</name>
   <postCode>OX2 6RB</postCode>
   <name type="country">United Kingdom</name>
</address></egXML>
 </p>

<p>The order of elements within an address is highly culture-specific,
and is therefore unconstrained:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <name type="org">Università di Bologna</name>
   <name type="country">Italy</name>
   <postCode>40126</postCode>
   <name type="city">Bologna</name>
   <street>via Marsala 24</street>
</address></egXML>
 </p>
<p>For further discussion of ways of regularizing the names of places,
see section <ptr target="#CONA"/>. A full postal address may also include
the name of the addressee, tagged as above using the general purpose
<gi>name</gi> element.    </p>

<p>When a schema includes the names and dates
module discussed in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/>, a large number of more specific elements such as <gi>country</gi> or <gi>settlement</gi> will be
available from the class <ident type="class">model.addrPart</ident>. The above
example might then be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address>
   <street>110 Southmoor Road</street>
   <settlement>Oxford</settlement>
   <postCode>OX2 6RB</postCode>
   <country>United Kingdom</country>
</address></egXML>

<div type="div3" xml:id="CONANU"><head>Numbers and
Measures</head>
<p>This section describes elements provided for the simple encoding
of numbers and measurements and gives some indication of circumstances in
which this may usefully be done.  The following phrase level elements
are provided for this purpose:
<specList><specDesc key="num" atts="type value"/><specDesc key="measure" atts="type"/><specDesc key="measureGrp"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Like names or abbreviations, numbers can occur virtually anywhere in
a text.  Numbers are special in that they can be written with either
letters or digits (<mentioned>twenty-one</mentioned>, <mentioned>xxi</mentioned>, and
<mentioned>21</mentioned>) and their presentation is language-dependent (e.g.
English <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English
<mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned> equals French <mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>).
 </p>
<p>For many kinds of application, e.g. natural-language processing or
machine translation, numbers are not regarded as
<soCalled>lexical</soCalled> in the same way as other parts of a text.
For these and other applications, the <gi>num</gi> element provides a
convenient method of distinguishing numbers from the surrounding text.
For other kinds of application, numbers are only useful if normalized:
here the <gi>num</gi> element is useful precisely because it provides a
standardized way of representing a numerical value.
 </p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><num value="33">xxxiii</num>
<num type="cardinal" value="21">twenty-one</num>
<num type="percentage" value="10">ten percent</num>
<num type="percentage" value="10">10%</num>
<num type="ordinal" value="5">5th</num></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><num type="fraction" value="0.5">one half</num>
<num type="fraction" value="0.5">1/2</num></egXML>
 </p>

<p>In its fullest form, a measure consists of a number, a phrase
expressing units of measure and a phrase expressing the commodity
being measured, though not all of these components need be present in
every case. It may be helpful to distinguish measures from surrounding
text for two reasons. Firstly, a measure may be expressed using a
particular notation or system of abbreviations which the encoder does
not wish to regard as lexical. Secondly, a quantitative application
may wish to distinguish and normalize the internal components of a
measure, in order to perform calculations on them.</p>

<p>Consider, as an example of the first case, the following list of
Celia's charms, in which the encoder has chosen to make  explicit the measurements:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-02"><div n="2"><list type="gloss">
<label>Age</label><item>Unimportant</item>
<label>Head</label><item>Small and round</item>
<label>Eyes</label><item>Green</item>
<label>Complexion</label><item>White</item>
<label>Hair</label><item>yellow</item>
<label>Features</label><item>Mobile</item>
<label>Neck</label><item><measure>13¾"</measure></item>
<label>Upper arm</label><item><measure>11"</measure></item>
<!--...-->
</list>
<!-- ... -->
</div></egXML>

In the same way, it may be convenient to mark 
representations of currency which might otherwise be misinterpreted as
lexical:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>...the sum of
<measure type="currency">12s 6d</measure>...</p></egXML>
</p>
<p>In general, normalization of a measure will require specification
of one or more of its three parts: the quantity, the units, and
possibly also the commodity being measured. This is accomplished by
supplying values for the three attributes <att>quantity</att>,
<att>unit</att>, and <att>commodity</att>, which are supplied by the
<ident type="class">att.measurement</ident> class:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.measurement" atts="quantity unit commodity"/>
</specList>
With these attributes, the measurement of Celia's neck may be
specified in a normalized form:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<measure quantity="13.75" unit="in">13¾"</measure>
</egXML>
Such techniques are particularly useful when representing historical
data such as inventories:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-03">
<list>
  <item><measure type="volume" quantity="2" unit="bag" commodity="hops"> ii bags hops </measure>
  </item>
  <item><measure type="volume" quantity="6" unit="truss" commodity="cloth">         six trusses Woolen and linen goods </measure>
  </item>
  <item><measure type="weight" quantity="5" unit="ton" commodity="coal">
        5 tonnes coale
       </measure>
  </item>
</list></egXML>
<!-- Gloucester Port Books -->
 </p> 
<p>The <gi>measureGrp</gi> element is provided as a means of grouping
several related measurements together, either because the measurement
involves several dimensions (for example height and width) or to
avoid the need to repeat all the normalizing attributes:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<measureGrp type="volume" unit="in">
<measure type="height" quantity="14">xiv</measure>
<measure type="width" quantity="5">v</measure>
<measure type="depth" quantity="10">x</measure>
</measureGrp>

</specGrp>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="CONADA"><head>Dates and Times</head>
<p>Dates and times, like numbers, can appear in widely varying
culture- and language-dependent forms, and can pose similar problems
in automatic language processing. Such elements constitute the <ident type="class">model.dateLike</ident> class, of which the default
members are:
 <specList>
   <specDesc key="date" atts="calendar"/>
   <specDesc key="time"/>
 </specList>
These elements have some additional attributes by virtue of being
members of the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> and <ident type="class">att.duration</ident> classes which, in turn, are members
of the <ident type="class">att.datable.w3c</ident> and <ident type="class">att.duration.w3c</ident> classes. In particular, the
<att>when</att> attribute will be discussed here:
<specList>
 <specDesc key="att.datable.w3c" atts="when"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>Dates can occur virtually anywhere in a text, but in some contexts
(e.g. bibliographic citations) their encoding is recommended or
required rather than optional.  Times can also appear anywhere but
are generally optional.
 </p>
<p>Partial dates or times (e.g. <mentioned>1990</mentioned>,
<mentioned>September 1990</mentioned>,
<mentioned>twelvish</mentioned>) can be expressed in the
<att>when</att> attribute by simply omitting a part of the value
supplied.  Imprecise dates or times (for example <mentioned>early
August</mentioned>, <mentioned>some time after ten and before
twelve</mentioned>) may be expressed as date or time ranges.
 </p>
<p>Where the certainty (i.e. reliability) of the date or time itself is
in question, rather than its precision, the encoder should record this
fact using the mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>.
 </p>
<p>These mechanisms are useful primarily for fully specified dates or
times known with certainty.  If component parts of dates or times are to
be marked up, or if a more complex analysis of the meaning of a temporal
expression is required, the techniques described in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> should be used in preference to the simple method
 outlined here.
 </p>
<p>The <att>when</att> attribute is a useful way of normalizing or
 disambiguating  dates and times which can appear in many formats, as
 the following examples show: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when="1980-02-12">12/2/1980</date></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Given on the <date when="1977-06-12">Twelfth Day of June
in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and
Seventy-seven of the Republic the Two Hundredth and first
and of the University the Eighty-Sixth.</date></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <att>when</att> attribute always supplies a normalized
representation of the date given as content of the <gi>date</gi>
element. The format used should be a valid W3C schema datatype.<note place="foot">The datatypes are taken from the W3C Recommendation <title>XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</title>. 
The permitted datatypes are:
<list type="simple">
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date">date</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYear">gYear</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gMonth">gMonth</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gDay">gDay</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYearMonth">gYearMonth</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gMonthDay">gMonthDay</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time">time</ref></item>
<item><ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime">dateTime</ref></item>
</list>
There 
is one exception: these Guidelines permit a time to be expressed as only a number of hours, or as a number of hours and minutes,
as per ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 and 4.3.3. 
The W3C <ident type="datatype">time</ident> and <ident type="datatype">dateTime</ident> 
datatypes require that the minutes and seconds be included in the
normalized value if they are to be correctly processed for example
when sorting.</note>
Some typical examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when="2001">The
year 2001</date>
<date when="2001-09">September 2001</date>
<date when="2001-09-11">11 Sept 01</date>
<date when="--09-11">9/11</date>
<date when="--09">September</date>
<date when="---11">Eleventh of the month</date>
<time when="08:48:00">8:48</time>
<date when="2001-09-11T12:48:00">Sept 11th, 12 minutes before 9 am</date>
</egXML>Note in the last example the use of a normalized representation for
the date string which includes a time: this example could thus equally
well be tagged using the <gi>time</gi> element. 
</p>
<p>The following examples demonstrate the use of the
<gi>date</gi> element to mark a period of time:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONADA-eg-143"><p>Those five years —

<div type="div3" xml:id="CONAAB"><head>Abbreviations and Their Expansions</head>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to mark abbreviations in the copy text,
whether to trigger special processing for them, to provide the full form
of the word or phrase abbreviated, or to allow for different possible
expansions of the abbreviation. Abbreviations may be transcribed as
they stand, or expanded; they may be left unmarked, or marked using
these tags: 
<specList>
<specDesc key="abbr"/>
<specDesc key="expan"/>
</specList>
</p><p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing
semi-lexical items such as acronyms or jargon:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONAAB-eg-150">We can sum up the above discussion as follows: the identity of a
<abbr>CC</abbr> is defined by that calibration of values which
motivates the elements of its <abbr>GSP</abbr>; ...</egXML>

<!-- .EXE magazine Editorial, 6.11, (May 1992) p2 -->
</p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish types
of abbreviation by their function:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <abbr type="initial">M.</abbr> Deegan is
the Director of the <abbr type="acronym">CTI</abbr> Centre for Textual Studies.</egXML>
 </p>
<p>Abbreviations such as <mentioned>Dr. M.</mentioned> above may be
treated as two abbreviations, as above, or as one: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><abbr>Dr. M.</abbr> Deegan is
the Director of the <abbr>CTI</abbr> Centre for Textual Studies.</egXML>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>expan</gi> element may be used simply to record that an
abbreviation has been silently expanded by the encoder, perhaps for
reasons of house style or editorial policy. It should
always include the whole of an abbreviated phrase or word. More
usually however this will be combined with the <gi>abbr</gi> element
inside a <gi>choice</gi> element to record both the abbreviation and
its expansion: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> the 
<choice><expan>World Wide Web Consortium</expan>
<abbr>W3C</abbr></choice></egXML>
Nested abbreviations may also be handled in this way:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>RELAXNG</abbr><expan>regular
language for <choice><abbr>XML</abbr><expan>extensible markup
language</expan></choice>, next
generation</expan></choice></egXML></p>

<p>Abbreviation is a particularly important feature of manuscript
and other source materials, the transcription of which needs more detailed treatment than
is possible using these simple elements. A more detailed set of
recommendations is discussed in <ptr target="#PHCH"/>, which includes
additional elements made available for the purpose by the <ident type="module">transcr</ident> module. </p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="COXR"><head>Simple Links and Cross References</head>
<p>Cross-references or links between one location in a document and one or more
other locations, either in the same or different XML documents, may be encoded
using the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi>, as discussed in this
section. These elements both <soCalled>point</soCalled> from one
location in a document, the place that the element itself appears, to
another (or to several), specified by the <att>target</att> attribute.
Linkages of several other kinds are also provided for in these
guidelines; see further chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.
 </p>
<p>The value of the <att>target</att> attribute, wherever it appears,
provides a way of pointing to some other element using a method
standardized by  the W3C consortium, and known as the <term>XPointer</term>
mechanism. This permits a range of complexity, from the very simple
(a reference to the value of  the target element's <att>xml:id</att>
attribute) to the more complex usage of a full URI with
embedded XPointers. For example, the source of the following paragraph
looks something like this: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>For an introduction
to the use of links in general, see <ptr target="#SA"/>; for the
complete XPointer specification, see <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/"/>, 
<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/"/>, 
<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xmlns/"/>, and 
<ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xpointer/#xpointer(id('chum')/quote)"/>;
for a discussion of TEI schemes for XPointer, see 
<ptr target="#SATS"/>.</p></egXML>
Alternatively, if no explicit link is to
be encoded, but it is simply required to mark the phrase as a
cross-reference, the <gi>ref</gi> element may be used without a
<att>target</att> attribute.</p>
<p>For an introduction to the use of links in general, see <ptr target="#SA"/>;
for the complete XPointer specification, see <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/"/>, <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/"/>, <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xmlns/"/>, and <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xpointer/#xpointer(id('chum')/quote)"/>; for a discussion of
TEI schemes for XPointer, see <ptr target="#SATS"/>.</p>
<p>
<specList><specDesc key="ptr" atts="target cRef"/><specDesc key="ref" atts="target cRef"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> are the default members
of the phrase-level model class <ident type="class">model.ptrLike</ident>. As
members of the class <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident>, they
also carry the following
attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.pointing" atts="type evaluate"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The two elements may be used in the same
way; the difference between them is simply that while the <gi>ptr</gi>
element is empty, the <gi>ref</gi> element may contain phrases
specifying, or describing more exactly, the target of a cross reference,
which form the content of the element. Since its content thus serves as
a human-readable pointer, in the simplest case a <gi>ref</gi> element
need not identify its target in any other way. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See <ref>section 12 on page 34</ref>.</egXML>
 </p>
<p>More usually, it will be desirable to identify the target of the
cross-reference using the <att>target</att> attribute, so that
processing software can access it directly, for example to implement a
linkage, to generate an appropriate reference, or to give an error
message if it cannot be found. Assuming that section
12 in the previous example has been tagged 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<div1 xml:id="SEC12"><!-- ... --> </div1></egXML> 
then the same cross reference might more exactly be encoded as 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on page 34</ref>.</egXML>
</p>
<p>If the text for the cross reference is to be generated according to a
fixed pattern, or if no text is to appear in the body of the cross
reference, the <gi>ptr</gi> element would be used as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See in particular <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML>
 </p>
<p>A cross-reference may point to any number of locations simultaneously,
simply by giving more than one identifier as the value of its
<att>target</att> attribute.  This may be particularly useful where
an analytic index is to be encoded, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COXR-eg-164"><list>
   <item>Saints aid rejected in mel. <ptr target="#p299"/></item>
   <item>Sallets censured <ptr target="#p143 #p144"/></item>
   <item>Sanguine mel. signs <ptr target="#p263"/></item>
   <item>Scilla or sea onyon, a purger of mel. <ptr target="#p442"/></item>
</list></egXML>
<!-- Burton: Anatomy of Melancholy, 16th ed 1651, reprinted   -->
	<!-- 1846, p743                                               -->
Here the targets of the cross references are simply page numbers; it
is assumed that corresponding elements with identifiers
<ident>p299</ident>, <ident>p143</ident>, etc. have been provided in
the body of the text, for example as page breaks
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<pb xml:id="p143"/>
...
<pb xml:id="p144"/>
...
<pb xml:id="p263"/>
...
<pb xml:id="p299"/>
...
<pb xml:id="p442"/>
...
</egXML>
</p>

<p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used,
as elsewhere, to categorize the cross reference according to any
system of importance to the encoder. If bibliographic references
require special processing (e.g. in order to provide a consistent
short-form reference), they might be tagged thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COXR-eg-166">Similar forms, often called
<term rend="ldquo rdquo">rewriting systems</term>, have a long history
among mathematicians, but the specific form of <ptr target="#fig22"/>
was first studied extensively by Chomsky <ptr type="bibliog" target="#chom59"/>.

	<!-- Ellis Horwood, 1990), p. 24.                             -->
The value <val>bibliog</val> for the <att>type</att> attribute on the
second <gi>ptr</gi> element here might be used to indicate that the
object being referenced here is a bibliographic entry rather than a
simple cross reference to an illustration, as is the first
<gi>ptr</gi>. In either case, the value of the <att>target</att>
attribute is a pointer to some other element.
 </p><p>The <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> elements have many applications in
addition to the simple cross-referencing facilities illustrated in this
section. In conjunction with the analytic tools discussed
in chapters <ptr target="#SA"/>, <ptr target="#AI"/>, and <ptr target="#FS"/>, they may be
used to link analyses of a text to their object, to combine
corresponding segments of a text, or to align segments of a text with a
temporal or other axis or with each other.</p>

</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="COLI"><head>Lists</head>
<p>The following elements are provided for the encoding of lists,
their constituent items, and the labels or headings associated
with them:
<specList><specDesc key="list"/><specDesc key="item"/><specDesc key="label"/><specDesc key="head"/><specDesc key="headLabel"/><specDesc key="headItem"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>list</gi> element should be used to mark any kind of
<term rend="noindex">list</term>:
numbered, lettered, bulleted, or unmarked.  Lists formatted as such in
the copy text should in general be encoded using this element, with an
appropriate value for the <att>type</att> attribute.  Lists given as
run-on text may also be encoded using this element, where this is felt
to be appropriate.
 </p>
<p>Each distinct item in the list should be encoded as a distinct
<gi>item</gi> element.  If the numbering or other identification for the
items in a list is unremarkable and may be reconstructed by any
processing program, no enumerator need be specified.  If however an
enumerator is retained in the encoded text, it may be supplied either by
using the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>item</gi> element, or by
using a <gi>label</gi> element.  The following examples are thus
equivalent:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I will add two facts, which have seldom occurred in
the composition of six, or at least of five quartos.
<list rend="runon" type="ordered">
      <label>(1)</label>
      <item>My first rough manuscript, without any
intermediate copy, has been sent to the press.</item>
      <label>(2)</label>
      <item>Not a sheet has been seen by any human
eyes, excepting those of the author and the printer:
the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.</item>
   </list></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I will add two facts, which have seldom occurred in
the composition of six, or at least of five quartos.
<list rend="runon" type="ordered">
      <item n="1">My first rough manuscript, without any
intermediate copy, has been sent to the press.</item>
      <item n="2">Not a sheet has been seen by any human
eyes, excepting those of the author and the printer:
the faults and the merits are exclusively my own.</item>
   </list></egXML>
The two styles may not be mixed in the same list:  if one item is
preceded by a label, all must be.
 </p>
<p>A list need not necessarily be displayed in list format.  For
example, the following is a reasonable encoding of a list which (in
the original) is simply printed as a single paragraph:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COLI-eg-171">On those remote pages it is written that animals are
divided into <list>

   <item n="j">innumerable ones, </item>
   <item n="k">those drawn with a very fine camel's-hair brush, </item>
   <item n="l">others, </item>
   <item n="m">those that have just broken a flower vase, </item>
   <item n="n">those that resemble flies from a distance. </item>

 </p>
<p>A list may be given a heading or title, for which the <gi>head</gi>
element should be used, as in the next example, which also demonstrates
simple use of the <gi>label</gi> element to mark a tabular or glossary
list in which each item is associated with a word or phrase rather than
a numeric or alphabetic enumerator:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COLI-eg-172"><list type="gloss">
 <head>Report of the conduct and progress of Ernest Pontifex.

 <label>General conduct</label>
 <item>Not satisfactory, on account of his great 
    unpunctuality and inattention to duties</item>
</list></egXML>
<!-- S Butler, Way of all Flesh, -->
 </p>
<p>In such a list, the individual items have internal structure.  In
complex cases, where list items contain many components, the list is
better treated as a <term rend="noindex">table</term>,
<index><term>tables</term><index><term>and
lists</term></index></index> on which see chapter <ptr target="#FT"/>.  A particularly important instance of the simple two-column
table is the <soCalled>glossary list</soCalled>, which should be marked
by the tag <tag>list type="gloss"</tag>.  In such lists, each
<gi>label</gi> element contains a term and each <gi>item</gi> its gloss;
it is a semantic error for a list tagged with <code>type="gloss"</code> not to have labels.  For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-04"><list type="gloss">
  <head>Unit Three — Vocabulary</head>
  <label xml:lang="la">acerbus, -a, -um     </label> <item>bitter, harsh</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">ager, agrī, M. </label> <item>field</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">audiō, īre,
    īvī, ītus         </label> <item>hear, listen (to)</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">bellum, -ī, N. </label> <item>war</item>
  <label xml:lang="la">bonus, -a, -um       </label> <item>good</item>
</list></egXML>
Additionally, the  <gi>term</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi> elements discussed
in section <ptr target="#COHQU"/> might be used to make explicit the role
that each column in the glossary list has, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss">
  <head>Unit Three — Vocabulary</head>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">acerbus, -a, -um</term> </label>
  <item><gloss>bitter, harsh</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">ager, agrī, M. </term> </label>
  <item><gloss>field</gloss> </item>
  <label>
	<term xml:lang="la">audiō, -īre, -īvī, -ītus</term>
  </label>
  <item><gloss>hear, listen (to)</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">bellum, -ī, N. </term> </label>
  <item><gloss>war</gloss> </item>
  <label><term xml:lang="la">bonus, -a, -um</term> </label>
  <item><gloss>good</gloss> </item>
</list></egXML>
Note in the above examples the use of the global <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute to specify on the <gi>label</gi> (or <gi>term</gi>) element
what language the term is from.  For further discussion of the
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute see section <ptr target="#STGA"/>, and
section <ptr target="#CHSH"/>.  A more elaborate markup for this
glossary would distinguish the headword forms from the grammatical
information (principal parts and gender), perhaps using elements taken
from <ptr target="#DI"/>.
<!--tags described more
fully in chapters <ptr target="#TE" type="div1"/> or <ptr target="#DI" type="div1"/>.-->
 </p>
<p>In addition to the <gi>head</gi> element used to supply
a title or heading for the whole list, headings for the two
columns of a glossary-style list may be specified using
the two special elements <gi>headLabel</gi> and <gi>headItem</gi>:

 </p>
<p>The elements <gi>label</gi>, <gi>head</gi>, <gi>headLabel</gi>, and
<gi>headItem</gi> may contain only phrase-level elements.  The
<gi>item</gi> element however may contain paragraphs or other
<soCalled>chunks</soCalled>, including other lists.  In this example, a
glossary list contains two items, each of which is itself a simple list:

discursive notes, either already present in the copy text or
supplied by the encoder:
<specList><specDesc key="note"/></specList>	
 </p>
<p>A <term rend="noindex">note</term><index><term>notes</term></index>
is any additional comment found in a text, marked in some way as being
out of the main textual stream.  All notes should be marked using the
same tag, <gi>note</gi>, whether they appear as block notes in the main
text area, at the foot of the page, at the end of the chapter or volume,
in the margin, or in some other place.
 </p>
<p>Notes may be in a different hand or typeface, may be authorial or
editorial, and may have been added later.  Attributes may be used to
specify these and other characteristics of notes, as detailed below.
 </p>
<p>Where possible, the body of a note should be inserted in the text
at the point at which its identifier or mark first appears. This may
not be possible for example with marginal notes, which may not be
anchored to an exact location. For simplicity, it may be adequate to
position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other
element. In some cases, however, it may be desirable to transcribe
notes not at their point of attachment to the text but at their point
of appearance (at the end of the volume, or the end of the chapter —
not, in general, when the notes appear at the foot of the page); in
this case the <att>target</att> attribute should be used to specify
the point of attachment. In some cases, the note is explicitly
attached not to a point but to a span of text; in which case both the
<att>target</att> and <att>targetEnd</att> attributes should be used
to specify the span of attachment. For a full discussion of pointing
to points and spans in the text, see section <ptr target="#COXR"/>.</p>

 </p>
<p>In addition to transcribing notes from the copy text, researchers may
wish to annotate the electronic text itself, by attaching analytic notes
in some structured vocabulary to particular passages of text, e.g. to
specify the topics or themes of a text.  The  <gi>span</gi> and
<gi>interp</gi>  elements
may be used for such applications; these elements are available when the

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="CONOIX"><head>Index Entries</head>
<p>The indexing of scholarly texts is a skilled activity, involving
substantial amounts of human judgment and analysis. It should not therefore be
assumed that simple searching and information retrieval software will
be able to meet all the needs addressed by a well-crafted manual
index, although it may complement them for example by providing free
text search. The role of an index is to provide access via
keywords and phrases which are not necessarily present in the text
itself, but must be added by the skill of the indexer. 
</p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="CONOIXpre"><head>Pre-existing indexes</head>
<p>When encoding a pre-existing text, therefore, if such an index
is present it may be advisable to retain it along with the text,
rather than attempt to regenerate it automatically. Elements discussed
elsewhere in these Guidelines may be used for this purpose. For
example, the <gi>div1</gi> element or <gi>div</gi> element may be used
to mark the section of the text containing the index and the
<gi>list</gi> element might be used to mark the index itself, each
entry being represented by an <gi>item</gi> element, possibly
containing within it a series of <gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi>
elements, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COXR-eg-164"><div type="index">
<!--...-->
<list type="index">
<item>Women, how cause of mel. <ref>193</ref>; their vanity in
apparell taxed, <ref>527</ref>; their counterfeit tears
<ref>547</ref>; their vices <ref>601</ref>, commended,
<ref>624</ref>.</item>
<item>Wormwood, good against mel. <ref>443</ref></item>
<item>World taxed, <ref>181</ref></item>
<item>Writers of the cure of mel. 295</item>
<!--...-->
</list>
</div></egXML>
</p>
<p>Note that this simple representation does not capture the nested
structure of the first of these index entries. A more accurate representation might
entail the use of nested lists like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><item>Women, 
   <list><item>how cause of mel. <ref>193</ref>;</item> 
      <item>their vanity in apparell taxed, <ref>527</ref>;</item>
      <item>their counterfeit tears <ref>547</ref>;</item>
      <item>their vices 
          <list><item><ref>601</ref>,</item>
              <item> commended, <ref>624</ref>.</item>
           </list></item>
   </list>
</item></egXML>
</p>
<p>The page references, encoded simply as <gi>ref</gi> elements above,
might also include direct links to the appropriate location in the
encoded text, using (for example) a target attribute to supply the
identifier of an associated page break element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><!-- in the text -->
<pb xml:id="P624"/> <!-- start of  page 624 -->
<!-- in the index -->
<ref target="#P624">624</ref>
</egXML>

For further discussion of this and alternative ways of encoding such
links see the discussion in section <ptr target="#SA"/>. Note that
similar methods may also be used to encode a table of contents, as
further exemplified in section <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="CONOIXgen"><head>Auto-generated indexes</head>
<p>It can also be useful, however, to generate a new index from a
machine-readable text, whether the text is being written for the first time
with the tags here defined, or as an addition to a text transcribed from
some other source. Depending on the complexity of the text and its subject
matter, such an automatically-generated index may not in itself satisfy all
the needs of scholarly users. However it can assist a professional indexer
to construct a fully adequate index, which might then be post-edited into
the digital text, marked-up along the lines already suggested for preserving
pre-existing index material.</p>
<p>Indexes generally contain both  references to specific pages or
sections and references to page ranges or sequences. The same element
is used in either case:
<specList>
<specDesc key="index"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>Like the <gi>interp</gi> element described in <ptr target="#AISP"/>
this element may be used simply to provide descriptive or interpretive
label of some kind for any location within a text, to be processed in
any way by analytic software, but its main purpose is to facilitate
the generation of an index for a printed version of the text. An
<gi>index</gi> element may be placed anywhere within a text, between
or within other elements. The
headwords to be used when making up this index are given by the
<gi>term</gi> elements within the <gi>index</gi>
element. The location of the generated index
might be specified by means of a processing instruction within the
text, such as the following (the exact form of the PI is of course
dependent on the application software in use):
<eg><![CDATA[<?tei indexplacement ?>]]></eg>
Alternatively, the special purpose  <gi>divGen</gi> element might be used.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, a single headword is supplied  by
an  <gi>term</gi> elements contained by an
<gi>index</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The students understand procedures for Arabic lemmatisation
<index>
  <term>Lemmatization, Arabic</term>
</index>and are beginning to build parsers.</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The effect of this will be to generate an index entry for the term
<q>Lemmatization</q>,
referencing the location of the original <gi>index</gi> element. </p>
<p>If the subject of Arabic lemmatization is treated at length
in a text, then the index entry generated may need to reference a
sequence of locations (e.g. page numbers). In such a case it will be necessary to identify the end of the relevant
span of text as well as its starting point. This is most conveniently
done by supplying an  empty <gi>anchor</gi> element (as discussed in chapter
<ptr target="#SA"/>) at the appropriate point and pointing to it from
the <gi>index</gi> element by means of its <att>spanTo</att>
attribute, as
in this example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>We now turn to the
topic of Arabic lemmatisation
<index spanTo="#ALAMEND">
  <term>Lemmatization, Arabic</term>
</index> concerning which it is important to note .....
<!-- much learned material omitted here -->
and now we can  build our parser.<anchor xml:id="ALAMEND"/></p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>This would generate the same index entries as the previous example,
but the reference would be to the whole span of text between the
location of the <gi>index</gi> element and the location of the element
identified by the code <ident>ALAMEND</ident>, rather than
a single point, and thus might (for
example) include a sequence of page numbers.</p>
<p>Although the position of the <gi>index</gi> element in the text
provides the target location that will be specified in the generated index
entry, no part of the text itself is used to construct that entry. Index
terms appearing in the entry come solely from the content of <gi>term</gi>
elements, which consequently may have to repeat words or phrases from the
text proper. This need not be done verbatim, thus giving scope for
normalization of spelling (as in the example above) or other modifications which may assist
generation of an index in a desired form or sequence.</p>
<!-- sorting -->
<p>Sometimes, for example when
index terms are taken from a different language or consist of
mathematical formulae or other expressions, even a
normalized form of an index term may be insufficent for an application to
order it exactly as desired. The <att>sortKey</att> attribute may be
used to address this problem, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The @ operator 
<index><term sortKey="0000">@</term></index> precedes an
attribute name</p></egXML> Here, an entry for the symbol @ will appear
in the index, but will be sorted alphabetically as if it were the
string <val>0000</val>. This technique is also useful when an index
entry is to contain some non-Unicode character or glyph represented by
the <gi>g</gi> element discussed in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>. In
the following example, we assume that somewhere a definition for this
glyph has been provided using the elements described in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>, and given the code <val>PrinceGlyph</val>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<char xml:id="PrinceGlyph">
<!-- definition of the glyph here -->
</char>

<p>The Artist formerly known as Prince  <index><term sortKey="Prince"><g ref="#PrinceGlyph"/></term></index>...</p></egXML>
Note that if no value is supplied for the sortKey attribute, a sorting
application should always use the content of the <gi>term</gi> element
as a sort key.</p>
<!-- multiple indexes -->
<p>It is common practice to compile more than one index for a given text.
A biography of a poet, for example, may offer an index of references to
poems by the subject of the study, another index of works by other writers,
an index of places or historical personages etc. The indexName
attribute is used to assigning index terms and locations to one or
more specific indexes:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Sir John Ashford
<index indexName="INDEX-PERSONS"><term>Ashford, John</term></index> was,
coincidentally, born in 
<index indexName="INDEX-PLACES"><term>Ashford
(Kent)</term></index>Ashford...</p></egXML></p>
<!-- multi-level indexing -->
<p>Multi-level indexing is particularly common in scholarly
documents. For example, as well as entries
such as <term>TEI</term>, or <term>markup</term>, an index  may contain structured entries like <term>TEI,
markup practices, index terms</term>, where a top level entry <term>TEI</term>
is followed by a number of second-level subcategories, any or all of
which may have a third-level list attached to them and so on. In order to
reflect such a hierarchical index listing,  <gi>index</gi>  elements may be
nested to the required depth. For example,
suppose that we wish to make a structured index entry for
<q>lemmatisation</q> with subentries for <q>Arabic</q>,
<q>Sanskrit</q>, etc. The example at the start of this section  might
then be encoded with  nested
<gi>index</gi> elements:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The students understand procedures for Arabic lemmatisation
    <index>
   <term>lemmatization</term>
   <index>
     <term>arabic</term>
   </index>
</index>
...</p></egXML></p>
<p>The  index entry from Burton's <title>Anatomy of
Melancholy</title> quoted above might be generated in a similar way. 
<!--<q rend="display">Women, how cause of mel. 193; their vanity in apparell taxed, 527;
their counterfeit tears 547; their vices 601, commended, 624.</q> -->
To generate such an entry, the body of the text might include, at page
193, an <gi>index</gi> element such as
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
    <term>how cause of mel.</term>
    </index>
</index>
</egXML>. Similary,  page 601 of the body text would include
an <gi>index</gi> element like the following:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
      <term>their vices</term>
    </index>
</index></egXML>
while the <gi>index</gi> element at page 624 would have a structure
like the following:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><index>
    <term>Women</term>
    <index>
      <term>their vices</term>
      <index>
      <term>commended</term>
      </index>
    </index>
 </index></egXML>       
</p>
<p>When processing such <gi>index</gi> elements, the duplication
required to make the structure explicit will normally be removed, so
as to produce entries like those quoted above. However, this is not
required by the encoding recommended here. </p>
<!-- generating the index -->
<p>As noted above, either a processing instruction or a <gi>divGen</gi>
element may be used to mark the place at which an index
generated from  <gi>index</gi> elements should be inserted into the
output of a processing program; typically but not necessarily this will be at some point
within the back matter of the document. If the <gi>divGen</gi> element
is used, then the  <att>type</att> attribute
should be used to specify which kind of index is to be generated, and
its value should correspond with that of the
<att>indexName</att> attribute on the relevant <gi>index</gi>
elements. 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<back>
   <div type="appendix">
      <head>Bibliography</head>
      <listBibl>
         <bibl> ... </bibl>
      </listBibl>
   </div>
   <divGen n="Index Nominum" type="INDEX-NAMES"/>
   <divGen n="Index Loci" type="INDEX-PLACES"/>
</back></egXML>
 </p>
<p>As this example shows, the global
<att>n</att> attribute may also be used to specify a name or
identifier for the
generated index itself in the usual way. Any additional headings
etc. required for the generated index must be specified as content of
the <gi>divGen</gi> element.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<back>
   <divGen n="A1" type="INDEX-NAMES">
   <head>An Index of Names</head>
   </divGen>
</back>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>If a processing instruction is used, then these parameters for the
generated index may be supplied in some other way.</p>
<p>One final feature frequently found in manually-created indexes to
printed works cannot readily be encoded by the means provided here,
namely cross references internal to the index term listing. For
example, if all references to the TEI in a text have been indexed
using the index term <term>Text Encoding Initiative</term>, it may
also be helpful to include an entry under the term <term>TEI</term>
containing some text such as <q>see Text Encoding Initiative</q>. Such
internal cross-references must be added as part of the post-editing
phase for an auto-generated index.</p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="COGR"><head>Graphics and other non-textual components</head>
<p>Graphics, such as illustrations or diagrams, appear in many
different kinds of text, and often with different purposes. In some
cases, the graphic is an integral part of a text (indeed, some texts —
comic books for example — may be almost entirely graphic); in others
the graphic may be a kind of optional extra. In some cases, the text
may be incomprehensible unless the graphic is included; in others, the
presence of the graphic adds very little to the sense of the
work. It will therefore be a matter of encoding policy as to whether
or how a graphic found in a source text is transferred to a digital
version of the same.  In documents which are <soCalled>born digital</soCalled>, graphics
and other forms of non-textual element may be particularly salient,
but their inclusion in an archival form of the document concerned
remains an editorial decision.</p>
<p>Considered as structural components, graphics may be anchored to a particular point in
the text, or they may <term>float</term> either completely freely, or
within some defined scope, such as a chapter or section. Graphics of
this kind often contain associated text such as a heading or label,
and may also nest hierarchically. These Guidelines recommend the following
different elements for these two cases:
<specList>
<specDesc key="figure"/>
<specDesc key="graphic"/>
<specDesc key="binaryObject"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>Graphic components may be encoded in a number of different ways:
<list type="simple">
<item>in some non-XML or binary format such as PNG, JPEG, etc.</item>
<item>in an XML format such as SVG</item>
<item>in a TEI XML format such as the notation for graphs and trees
described in <ptr target="#GD"/></item>
</list> In the last two cases, the  presence of the graphic
will be indicated by an appropriate XML element, drawn from the SVG
namespace in the second case, and its content will fully define the
graphic to be produced. In the first case, the element
<gi>graphic</gi> is used to mark the presence of the graphic only and the
visual content is stored outside the XML document, and its location is
referenced by means of an <att>url</att> attribute. Alternatively, if
the graphical information is embedded directly within the document
using some suitable binary format such as Base64, the
<gi>binaryObject</gi> element may be used to contain it.
</p>
<p>The elements <gi>graphic</gi> and <gi>binaryObject</gi> are made
available as members of the class <ident type="class">model.graphicLike</ident> when this module is included in
a schema. These elements are also both members of the class <ident type="class">att.internetMedia</ident>, from which they inherit the
following attribute: <specList><specDesc key="att.internetMedia" atts="mimeType"/></specList></p>

<p>For example, the following passage indicates that a copy of the  image
found in the source text may be recovered from the URL
<ident>zigzag2.png</ident> and that this image is in PNG format:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COHQHE-eg-13"><p>These were the four lines I moved in
through my first, second, third, and
fourth volumes.   -- In the fifth volume
I have been very good,   -- the precise
line I have described in it being this :     
<graphic url="zigzag2.png" mimeType="image/png"/>      
By which it appears, that except at the
curve, marked A. where I took a trip
to Navarre, -- and the indented curve B.
which is the short airing when I was
there with the Lady Baussiere and her
page, -- I have not taken the least frisk

</p>	
<p>The <gi>graphic</gi> and <gi>binaryObject</gi> elements  are phrase
level  elements which may be used
anywhere  that textual content is permitted, within but not between
paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has
decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head>
</egXML>. </p>
<p>The <gi>figure</gi>
element discussed in <ptr target="#FTGRA"/> provides additional
capabilities, for example the ability to combine a number of images
into a hierarchically organized structure or a block of images. It
also provides the ability to associate an image with additional information
such as a heading or a description.</p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="CORS"><head>Reference Systems</head>
<p>By <mentioned>reference system</mentioned> we mean the system by which names
or references are associated with particular passages of a text (e.g.
<mentioned>Ps. 23:3</mentioned> for the third verse of Psalm 23 or <mentioned>Amores
2.10.7</mentioned> for Ovid's <title>Amores</title>, book 2, poem 10, line
7).  Such names make it possible to mark a place within a text and
enable other readers to find it again.  A reference system may be based
on structural units (chapters, paragraphs, sentences; stanza and verse),
typographic units (page and line numbers), or divisions created
specifically for reference purposes (chapter and verse in Biblical
texts).  Where one exists, the traditional reference system for a text
should be preserved in an electronic transcript of it, if only to make
it easier to compare electronic and non-electronic versions of the text.
 </p>
<p>Reference systems may be recorded in TEI-encoded texts in any of the
following ways:
<list type="simple">
<item>where a reference system exists, and is based on the same
logical structure as that of the text's markup, the reference for
a passage may be recorded as the value of the global <att>xml:id</att> or
<att>n</att> attribute on an appropriate tag, or may be constructed by
combining attribute values from several levels of tags, as described
below in section <ptr target="#CORS1"/>.
 </item>
<item>where there is no pre-existing reference system, the global
<att>xml:id</att> or <att>n</att> attributes may be used to construct one
(e.g. collections and corpora created in electronic form), as described
below in section <ptr target="#CORS2"/>.
 </item>
<item>where a reference system exists which is not based on the same
logical structure as that of the text's markup (for example, one
based on the page and line numbers of particular editions of the text
rather than on the structural divisions of it), any of a
variety of methods for encoding the logical structure representing
the reference system may be employed, as described in chapter
<ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </item>
<item>where a reference system exists which does not correspond to any
particular logical structure, or where the logical structure concerned
is of no interest to the encoder except as a means of supporting the
referencing system, then references may be encoded by means of
<gi>milestone</gi> elements, which simply mark points in the text at
which values in the reference system change, as described below in
section <ptr target="#CORS5"/>.
 </item></list>
The specific method used to record traditional or new reference systems
for a text should be declared in the TEI header, as further described in
section <ptr target="#CORS6"/> and in section <ptr target="#SACR"/>.
 </p>
<p>When a text has no pre-existing associated reference system of any
kind, these Guidelines recommend as a minimum that at least the page
boundaries of the source text be marked using one of the methods
outlined in this section.  Retaining page breaks in the markup is also
recommended for texts which have a detailed reference system of their
own. Line breaks in prose texts may be, but need not be, tagged.<note place="foot">Many encoders find it convenient to retain the line
breaks of the original during data entry, to simplify proof-reading,
but this may be done without inserting a tag for each line break of
the original.</note></p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="CORS1"><head>Using the <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> Attributes</head>
<p>When traditional reference schemes represent a hierarchical
structuring of the text which mirrors that of the marked-up document, the
<att>n</att> attribute defined for all elements may be used to indicate
the traditional identifier of the relevant structural units. The
<att>n</att> attribute may also be used to record the numbering of
sections or list items in the copy text if the copy-text numbering is
important for some reason, for example because the numbers are out of
sequence.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional reference to Ovid's
<title>Amores</title> might be <mentioned>Amores
2.10.7</mentioned>—book 2, poem 10, line 7. Book, poem, and
line are structural units of the work and will therefore be tagged in
any case. (See chapter <ptr target="#VE"/> for a
discussion of structural units in verse collections.) In such cases,
it is convenient to record traditional reference numbers of the
structural units using the <att>n</att> attribute. The relevant tags
for our example would be:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 n="Amores" type="volume">
  <div2 n="1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div2>
  <div2 n="2" type="book">
      <div3 n="1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div3>
      <div3 n="2" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div3>
      <!-- ... -->
      <div3 n="10" type="poem">
          <l n="1"> ... </l>
          <l n="2"> ... </l>
          <!-- ... -->
          <l n="7"> ... </l>
      </div3>
      <!-- ... -->
  </div2>
  <!-- ... -->
</div1></egXML>
 </p>
<p>One may also place the entire standard reference for each portion of
the text into the appropriate value for the <att>n</att> attribute,
though for obvious reasons this takes more space in the file:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 n="Amores" type="volume">
  <div2 n="Amores 1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div2>
  <div2 n="Amores 2" type="book">
    <div3 n="Amores 2.1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div3>
    <!-- ... -->
    <div3 n="Amores 2.10" type="poem">
      <!-- ... -->
      <l n="Amores 2.10.7"> ... </l>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div3>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div2>
  <!-- ... -->
</div1></egXML>
 </p>
<p>If the names used by the traditional reference system can be
formulated as identifiers, then the references can be given as values
for the <att>xml:id</att> attribute; this requires that the reference
be given without internal spaces, begin with a letter or underscore,
and contain no characters other than letters, digits, hyphens,
underscores, full stops, and the various combining and extender
characters, as defined by the XML specification.  Unlike values for
the <att>n</att> attribute, values for the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
must be unique throughout the document. Our example then looks like
this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div1 n="Amores" type="volume"> <div2 xml:id="am.1" type="book"><!-- ... --></div2>
  <div2 xml:id="am.2" type="book">
    <div3 xml:id="am.2.1" type="poem"><!-- ... --></div3>
    <!-- ... -->
    <div3 xml:id="am.2.10" type="poem">
      <!-- ... -->
      <l xml:id="am.2.10.7"> ... </l>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div3>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div2>
  <!-- ... -->
</div1></egXML>
</p>
<p>To document the usage and to allow automatic processing of these
standard references, it is recommended that the TEI header be used to
declare whether standard references are recorded in the <att>n</att> or
<att>xml:id</att> attributes and which elements may carry standard
references or portions of them. For examples of declarations for the
reference systems just shown, see section <ptr target="#CORS6"/>.
 </p>
<p>Using the <att>n</att> attribute one can specify only a single
standard referencing system, a limitation not without problems, since
some editions may define structural units differently and thus create
alternative reference systems.  For example, another edition of the
<title>Amores</title> considers poem 10 a continuation of poem 9, and
therefore would specify the same line as <mentioned>Amores 2.9.31</mentioned>.
In order to record both of these reference systems  one
could employ any of a variety of methods discussed in chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="CORS2"><head>Creating New Reference Systems</head>
<p>If a text has no canonical reference system of its own, a reference
system, if needed, may be derived from the structure of the electronic
text, specifically from the markup of the text.  As with any
reference system intended for long-term use, it is important to see the
reference as an established, unchanging point in the text.  Should the
text be revised or rearranged, the reference-system identifiers
associated with any bit of text must stay with that bit of text, even if
it means the reference numbers fall out of sequence.  (A new reference
system may always be created beside the old one if out-of-sequence
numbers must be avoided.)
 </p>
<p>The global attributes <att>n</att> and <att>xml:id</att> may be used to
assign reference identifiers to segments of the text.  Identifiers
specified by either attribute apply to the entire element for which they
are given.  ID attributes must be unique within a single
document, and ID values must begin with a letter.  No such restrictions
are made on the values of <att>n</att> attributes.
 </p>
<p>A convenient method of mechanically generating unique values for
<att>xml:id</att> or <att>n</att> attributes based on the structure of
the document is to construct, for each element, a <term>domain-style
address</term> comprising a series of components separated by full
stops, with one component for each level of the document hierarchy.
Two methods may be used.  In the <term>typed path</term> form of
identifier, each component in the identifier takes the form of an
element identifier, a hyphen, and a number, for example
<code>p-2</code>. The element name specifies what type of
element is to be sought, and the number specifies which occurrence of that
element type is to be selected.  (The hyphen and number may be omitted
if there is only one element of the given type.)  In the <term>untyped
path</term> form of identifier, each component consists of a number,
indicating which element in the sequence of nodes at each level is to be
selected.  <!--A fixed prefix beginning with a letter may be used to make
the untyped path legal as an <code type="kw">ID</code> value.-->
 </p>
<p>Identifiers generated with these methods should use the <gi>text</gi>
element as their starting point, rather than the <gi>TEI</gi> or
<gi>body</gi> elements. The <gi>TEI</gi> element may be taken
as a starting point only if identifiers need to be generated for the
<gi>teiHeader</gi>, which is not usually the case;  using the
<gi>body</gi> element as a root would prevent assignment of identifiers
for the front and back matter.  The component corresponding to the root
element can be omitted from identifiers, if no confusion will result.
In collections and corpora, the component corresponding to the root may
be replaced by the unique identifier assigned to the text or sample.
 </p>
<p>In the following example, each element within the <gi>text</gi>
element has been given a typed-path identifier as its <att>xml:id</att>
value, and an untyped-path identifier as its <att>n</att> value; the
latter are prefixed with the string <mentioned>AB</mentioned>, which may be
imagined to be the general identifier for this text.

The typed and untyped path methods are convenient, but are in no way
required for anyone creating a reference system.
 </p>
<p>If the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is used to record the reference
identifiers generated, each value should record the entire path.  If the
<att>n</att> attribute is used, each value may record either the entire
path or only the subpath from the parent element.  The attribute
used, the elements which can bear standard reference identifiers, and
the method for constructing standard reference identifiers, should all
be declared in the header as described in section <ptr target="#HD54"/>.
 </p>
<!-- <p>When the hierarchy of the encoded document and that of the
reference system differ (e.g. for reference systems based on page and
line numbers) or when more than one reference system is to be encoded,
the encoder of an SGML (but not XML) TEI text may choose to represent the alternative reference system(s)
as elements in one or more concurrent document hierarchies.  For an
introduction to the concept of concurrent hierarchies, see section <ptr target="#SG152" type="div1"/>.  For further discussion of this and other
mechanisms, see chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>.
 </p>--></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="CORS5"><head>Milestone
Elements</head><p>Where the desired reference system does not
correspond to any particular structural hierarchy, or the document
combines multiple structural hierarchies (as further discussed in <ptr target="#NH"/>), simpler though less expressive methods may be
necessary. In such cases the simplest solution may be just to mark up
changes in the reference system where they occur, by using one or more
of the following <term>milestone</term> elements: <specList><specDesc key="milestone"/><specDesc key="pb"/><specDesc key="lb"/><specDesc key="cb"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>These elements simply mark the points in a text at which some
category in a reference system changes.  They have no content but
subdivide the text into regions, rather in the same way as milestones
mark points along a road, thus implicitly dividing it into segments.
The elements <gi>pb</gi>, <gi>cb</gi>, and <gi>lb</gi> are specialised
types of milestone, marking page, column, and line boundaries.  The
global <att>n</att> attribute is used in each case to provide a value
for the particular unit associated with this milestone (for example,
the page or line number).  Since it is not structural, validation of a
reference system based on <gi>milestone</gi>s cannot be checked by an
XML parser, so it will be the responsibility of the encoder or the
application software to ensure that they are given in the correct
order.</p>
<p>Milestones are useful where a text has two competing
structures. For example, many English novels were first published as
serial works, individual parts of which do not always contain a whole
number of chapters. An encoder might decide to represent the
chapter-based structure using <gi>div1</gi> elements, with
<gi>milestone</gi> elements to mark the points at which individual
parts end; or the reverse. Thus, an encoding in which chapters are
regarded as more important than parts might encode some work in which
chapter three begins in part one and is concluded in part two as
follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text><body>
    <milestone unit="part" n="1"/>
    <div1 n="1" type="chapter">
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
    </div1>
    <div1 n="2" type="chapter">
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
    </div1>
    <div1 n="3" type="chapter">
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
       <milestone unit="part" n="2"/>
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
    </div1>

  </body></text></egXML>
An encoding of the same work in which parts are regarded as more
important than chapters might begin as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text>
  <body>
    <div1 n="1" type="part">
      <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
        <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
        <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
    </div1>
    <div1 n="2" type="part">
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
        <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
      <p> <!-- ... --> </p>
    </div1>
  </body>
</text></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Milestone tags also make it possible to record the reference systems
used in a number of different editions of the same work. The reference
system of any one edition can be recreated from a text in which all are
marked by simply ignoring all elements that do not specify that edition
on their <att>ed</att> attribute.
 </p>
<p>As a simple example, assuming that edition E1 of some collection of
poems regards the first two poems as constituting the first book, while
edition E2 regards the first poem as prefatory, a markup scheme like
the following might be adopted:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone ed="E1" unit="work"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="work"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="book"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem"/>
<milestone ed="E2" unit="poem"/>
  </egXML>
 </p>
<p>In this case no <att>n</att> value is specified, since the numbers
rise predictably and the application can keep a count from the start of
the document, if desired.
 </p>
<p>The value of the <att>n</att> attribute may but need not include the
identifiers used for any larger sections.  That is, either of the
following styles is legitimate:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone ed="E1" unit="work" n="Amores"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book" n="1"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem" n="1"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem" n="2"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book" n="2"/></egXML>
or
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><milestone ed="E1" unit="work" n="Amores"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book" n="1"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem" n="1.1"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="poem" n="1.2"/>
<milestone ed="E1" unit="book" n="2"/></egXML>
 </p>
<p>When using <gi>milestone</gi> tags, line numbers may be supplied for
every line or only periodically (every fifth, every tenth line).  The
latter may be simpler; the former is more reliable.
 </p>
<p>The style of numbering used in the values of <att>n</att> is
unrestricted: for the example above, <val>I.i</val>, <val>I.ii</val>,
and <val>I.iii</val> could have been used equally well if preferred.
The special value <val>unnumbered</val> should be reserved for marking
sections of text which fall outside the normal numbering system
(e.g. chapter heads, poem numbers, titles, or speaker attributions in
a verse drama).
 </p>
<p>By default,  there are no constraints on the values supplied for
the <att>ed</att> attribute. If it is felt
appropriate to enforce such a restriction, the techniques described in
<ptr target="#MD"/> may be used, for example to specify that the
attribute must specify one of a predefined set of values. 
 </p>
<p>See below, section <ptr target="#CORS6"/>, for examples of
declarations for the reference systems just shown.

<div type="div3" xml:id="CORS6"><head>Declaring Reference Systems</head>
<p>Whatever kind of reference system is used in an electronic text, it
is recommended that the TEI header contain a description of its
construction in the <gi>refsDecl</gi> element described in section
<ptr target="#HD54"/>. As described there, the declaration
may consist either of a formal declaration using the
<gi>cRefPattern</gi> element or an informal description in prose.  The
former is recommended because unlike prose it can be processed by
software.</p>

<p>The three examples given in section <ptr target="#CORS1"/> would be declared as follows. The first example encodes
the standard references for Ovid's <title>Amores</title> one level at
a time, using the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>div1</gi>,
<gi>div2</gi>, <gi>div3</gi>, and <gi>l</gi> tags. The header for such
an encoding should look something like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiHeader> <fileDesc><!--
... --></fileDesc>
    <encodingDesc>
         <refsDecl>
           <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//div1[@n='$1']/div2[@n='$2']/div3[@n='$3']/l[@n='$4']">
	     <p>A canonical reference is assembled with
	     <list>
	       <item>the name of the <label>work</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a <gi>div1</gi>,</item>
	       <item>a space,</item>
	       <item>the number of the <label>book</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a child <gi>div2</gi>,</item>
	       <item>a full stop</item>
	       <item>the number of the <label>poem</label>: the
	       <att>n</att> of a child <gi>div3</gi>,</item>
	       <item>the line number: the <att>n</att> value of a
	       child <gi>l</gi></item>
	     </list>
	     </p>
	   </cRefPattern>
           <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//div1[@n='$1']/div2[@n='$2']/div3[@n='$3']">
	     <p>Same as above, but without the last component (full
	     stop followed by the <gi>l</gi>'s <att>n</att>.</p>
	   </cRefPattern>
           <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+) ([0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//div1[@n='$1']/div2[@n='$2']">
	     <p>Same as above, but without the poem component (full
	     stop followed by the <gi>div3</gi>'s <att>n</att>.</p>
	   </cRefPattern>
         </refsDecl>         
    </encodingDesc>
</teiHeader></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The second example encodes the same reference system, again using
the <att>n</att> attribute on the <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>,
<gi>div3</gi>, and <gi>l</gi> tags, but giving the reference string in
full on each tag. If canonical references are made only to lines, the
reference system could be declared as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//l[@n='$1')"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
Since the entire regular expression is enclosed as a parenthetical
subgroup, the entire canonical reference string is sought as the value
of the <att>n</att> attribute on an <gi>l</gi> element.</p>
<p>In order to handle references to poems as well as to individual
lines, the declaration for the reference system must be more
complicated:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//l[@n='$1')"/>
  <cRefPattern matchPattern="([^ ]+ [0-9]+\.[0-9]+)" replacementPattern="#xpath(//div2[@n='$1')"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
This declaration indicates that the entire reference string must be
sought as the value of the <att>n</att> attribute on a <gi>div1</gi>,
<gi>div2</gi>, <gi>div3</gi>, or <gi>l</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>The third example encodes the same reference system, this time
giving the entire reference string as the value of the
<att>xml:id</att> attribute on the relevant tags. The reference system
declaration for such an encoding could be:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
  <cRefPattern matchPattern="(.*)" replacementPattern="#$1"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
although in general there seems to be little advantage in this case:
it is no more difficult to use a standard relative URI reference as
the value of <att>target</att>.</p>
<p>Reference systems recorded by means of milestone tags can also be
declared; the following prose description could be used to declare
the example given in section <ptr target="#CORS5"/>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
   <p>Standard references to work, book, poem, and line may be
     constructed from the milestone tags in the text.</p>
</refsDecl></egXML>
Or in this way, using a formal declaration for this reference scheme
derived from edition <val>E1</val>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl>
   <refState ed="E1" unit="work" delim=" "/>
   <refState ed="E1" unit="book" delim="."/>
   <refState ed="E1" unit="poem" delim=":"/>
   <refState ed="E1" unit="line"/>
</refsDecl></egXML>
 </p>
</div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="COBI"><head>Bibliographic Citations and References</head>
<p>Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic
items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or
pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text.  They are
required at several points within the TEI Header's source description,
as discussed in section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; they may also appear within
the body of a text, either singly (for example within a footnote), or
collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text; detailed
bibliographic descriptions of manuscript or other source materials may
also be required. These Guidelines propose a number of specialised
elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident> class.  By default, this class has
the following members:
<specList>
<specDesc key="bibl"/>
<specDesc key="biblStruct"/>
<specDesc key="biblFull"/>
</specList>
Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:
<specList>
<specDesc key="listBibl"/></specList>
</p>

<p>In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic
reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the
flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special
punctuation conventions, underlining, etc.  In electronic texts, such
distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce
acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval
processing,<note place="foot">For example, to distinguish
<mentioned>London</mentioned> as an author's name from
<mentioned>London</mentioned> as a place of publication or as a
component of a title.</note> quite apart from the need to distinguish
the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic
properties.
 </p>

<p>It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual
features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should
be formatted when it is printed.  The distinctions permitted by the
scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular
formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove
adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software
systems.<note place="foot">Among the bibliographic software systems
and subsystems consulted in the design of the <gi>biblStruct</gi>
structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite.  The distinctions made by
all three may be preserved in <gi>biblStruct</gi> structures, though
the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from
their data elements to TEI elements.  For further information, see
section <ptr target="#COBIOT"/>.</note> The features distinguished and
described below (in section <ptr target="#COBICO"/>) constitute a set
which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and
in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent
with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice.  For a
fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see
section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; for a brief mention of related library
standards see section <ptr target="#HD8"/>.
 </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COBITY"><head>Elements of Bibliographic References</head>
<p>
The members of the <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident> class
all share a number of possible component sub-elements.  For the
<gi>bibl</gi> and <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements, exactly the same
sub-elements are concerned, and they are described together in section
<ptr target="#COBICO"/>; for the <gi>biblFull</gi> element, the
sub-elements concerned are fully described in section <ptr target="#HD2"/>.
 </p>
<p>Different levels of specific tagging may be appropriate in different
situations.  In some cases, it may be felt necessary to mark just the
extent of the reference itself, with perhaps a few distinctions being
made within it (for example, between the part of the reference which
identifies a title or author and the rest).  Such references, containing
a mixture of text with specialized bibliographic elements, are regarded
as <gi>bibl</gi> elements, and tagged accordingly.  For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>A book which had a great influence on him
was <bibl>Tufte's <title>Envisioning
Information</title></bibl>, although he may
never have actually read it.</p></egXML>
Indeed, some encoders may find it unnecessary to mark the bibliographic
reference at all:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>A book which had a great influence on him
was Tufte's <title>Envisioning Information</title>,
although he may never have actually read it.</p></egXML>
 </p>
<p>Some bibliographic references are extremely elliptical, often only a
string of the form <mentioned>Baxter, 1983</mentioned>.  If no further details of
Baxter's book are given in the source text and none are supplied by the
encoder, then the reference thus given should be tagged as a
<gi>bibl</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">All of this is of course much more fully treated
in <bibl>Baxter, 1983</bibl>.</egXML>
In general, however, normal modern bibliographic practice, and these
Guidelines, distinguish between a bibliographic <term rend="noindex">reference</term>,<index><term>references</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index><index><term>bibliographic references</term></index>
which is a self-sufficient description of a bibliographic item, and a
bibliographic <term rend="noindex">pointer</term>,<index><term>bibliographic pointers</term></index><index><term>pointers</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>
which is a short-form citation (e.g. <mentioned>Baxter,
1983</mentioned>) which serves usually as a place-holder or pointer to
a full long-form reference found elsewhere in the text.  The usual
encoding of short-form references such as <mentioned>Baxter,
1983</mentioned> is not as <gi>bibl</gi> elements but as
cross-references to such elements; see section <ptr target="#COBIXR"/>
below.  </p> 
<p>In cases where the encoder wishes to impose more structure on the
bibliographic information, for example to make sure it conforms to a
particular stylesheet or retrieval processor, the <gi>biblStruct</gi>
element should be used.  Note that several of the features in this and
later examples are explained later in the current section.

<p>A more complex and detailed bibliographic structure is provided by the
<gi>biblFull</gi> element defined in the TEI header module. This
element is provided as a means of embedding the file description of
one existing digital text within that of another (see further section
<ptr target="#HD2"/>); however, its use is not confined to digital
texts, and it may be used in the same way as any other bibliographic
element, as in this example:
 	<!-- titstmt requires title first -->

<p>A list of bibliographic items, of whatever kind, may be treated in
the same way as any other list (see section <ptr target="#COLI"/>).
Alternatively, the specialized <gi>listBibl</gi> element may be used.
The difference between the two is that a <gi>list</gi> contains
<gi>item</gi> elements, within which bibliographic elements (<gi>bibl</gi>,
<gi>biblStruct</gi>, or <gi>biblFull</gi>) may appear, as well as other
phrase- and paragraph-level elements, whereas the <gi>listBibl</gi> may
contain only bibliographic elements, optionally preceded by a heading and a
series of introductory paragraphs.  The former would be appropriate
for a list of bibliographic elements in which descriptive prose
predominated, and the latter for a more formal bibliography.  The
following are thus both legal encodings of a list of bibliographic
entries:  a <gi>listBibl</gi>:

<div type="div3" xml:id="COBICO"><head>Components of Bibliographic References</head>
<p>This section discusses a number of very commonly occurring
component elements of bibliographic references.  They fall into four
groups:
<list type="simple">
<item>elements for grouping components of the
<term>analytic</term>,
<term>monographic</term>,
and <term>series</term>
<!--
<index><term>analytic level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>

levels in a structured bibliographic reference</item>
<item>titles of various kinds, and statements of intellectual
responsibility (authorship, etc.)</item>
<item>information relating to the publication, pagination, etc. of an
item (most of these
constitute the default members of the <ident type="class">model.biblPart</ident> class) </item>
<item>annotation, commentary, and further detail</item></list>
The following sections describe the elements which may be used to
represent such information within a <gi>bibl</gi> or
<gi>biblStruct</gi> element.  Within the former, elements from the
<ident type="class">model.biblPart</ident> class, other phrase-level elements, and plain text may
be combined without other constraint; within the latter, such of these elements
as exist for a given reference must be distinguished, and must also be
presented in a specific order, discussed further below (section <ptr target="#COBICOO"/>).
 </p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="COBICOL"><head>Analytic, Monographic, and Series Levels</head>
<p>In common library practice a clear distinction is made between an
individual item within a larger collection and a free-standing book,
journal, or collection.  Similarly a book in a series is distinguished
sharply from the series within which it appears.  An article forming
part of a collection which itself appears in a series thus has a
bibliographic description with three quite distinct levels of
information:
<list type="ordered">
<item>the <term rend="noindex">analytic</term><!--<index><term>analytic level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>-->
level, giving the title, author, etc., of the article;
 </item>
<item>the <term rend="noindex">monographic</term><!--<index><term>monographic level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>-->
level, giving the title, editor, etc., of the collection;
 </item>
<item>the <term rend="noindex">series</term><!--<index><term>series level</term><index><term>bibliographic</term></index></index>-->
level, giving the title of the series, possibly the names of its
editors, etc., and the number of the volume within that series.
 </item></list>
In the same way, an article in a journal requires at least two levels of
information:  the analytic level describing the article itself, and the
monographic level describing the journal.
 </p>
<p>These three levels may be distinguished within a <gi>bibl</gi>
element, and must be distinguished within a <gi>biblStruct</gi> element
if present, by means of the following elements:

<specList><specDesc key="analytic"/><specDesc key="monogr"/><specDesc key="series"/></specList>
 </p>

<p>For purposes of TEI encoding, journals and anthologies are both
treated as monographs; a journal title will thus be tagged as a
<tag>title level="j"</tag> element, or simply as a <gi>title</gi> within
a <gi>monogr</gi> element.  Individual articles in the journal or
collected texts should be treated at the <soCalled>analytic</soCalled>
level.  When an article has been printed in more than one journal or
collection, the bibliographic reference may have more than one
<gi>monogr</gi> element, each possibly followed by one or more
<gi>series</gi> elements.  A <gi>series</gi> element always relates to
the most recently preceding <gi>monogr</gi> element.  (Whether
reprints of an article are treated in the same bibliographic reference
or a separate one varies among different styles.  Library lists
typically use a different entry for each publication, while academic
footnoting practice typically treats all publications of the same
article in a single entry.)
 </p>
<p>For example, the article cited in this example has been published
twice, once in a journal and once in a collection which appeared in a
German language series:

 </p>

<p>The practice of analytic vs. monographic citation, as described here,
should be distinguished from the practice of including within one
citation a reference to another work, which the encoder considers
to be related to in some way: see further <ptr target="#COBIRI"/> below.</p>

<p>Punctuation should not appear between the elements within a structured
bibliographic entry, unless it is contained within the elements it delimits.  As the
example shows, it is possible to encode the entry without any
inter-element punctuation:  this facilitates use of the
<gi>biblStruct</gi> element in systems which can render bibliographic
references in any of several styles.
 </p>
<specGrp xml:id="DCOBILV" n="Levels of bibliographic information">

</specGrp>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="COBICOR"><head>Authors, Titles, and Editors</head>
<p>Bibliographic references typically begin with a statement of the
title being cited followed by the names of those intellectually
responsible for it.  For articles in journals or collections, such
statements should appear both for the analytic and for the monographic
level.  The following elements are provided for tagging such elements:
<specList><specDesc key="title"/><specDesc key="author"/><specDesc key="editor"/><specDesc key="respStmt"/><specDesc key="resp"/><specDesc key="name"/><specDesc key="meeting"/></specList>
The elements <gi>author</gi>, <gi>editor</gi>, and <gi>respStmt</gi>
are the default members of the <ident type="class">model.respLike</ident> class, a subclass of the <ident type="class">model.biblPart</ident> class to which the constituents of
the <gi>bibl</gi> element belong.</p>

<p>In bibliographic references, all titles should be tagged as such,
whether analytic, monographic, or series titles.  The single element
<gi>title</gi> is used for all these cases.  When it appears directly
within an <gi>analytic</gi>, <gi>monogr</gi>, or <gi>series</gi>
element, <gi>title</gi> is interpreted as belonging to the appropriate
level.  When it appears elsewhere, its <att>level</att> attribute should
be used to signal its bibliographic level.  It is a semantic error to
give a value for the <att>level</att> attribute which is inconsistent
with the context; such values may be ignored.  The <att>level</att>
value <val>a</val> implies the analytic level; the values
<val>m</val>, <val>j</val>, and <val>u</val> imply the monographic level; the value <val>s</val> implies the series level.  Note, however, that the
semantic error occurs only if the nested title is directly enclosed by
the <gi>analytic</gi>, <gi>monogr</gi>, or <gi>series</gi> element; if
it is enclosed only indirectly (i.e., nested more deeply), no semantic error need be present.  For
example, the analytic title may contain a monographic title:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblStruct>
   <analytic>
      <author>Lucy Allen Paton</author>
      <title>Notes on Manuscripts of the 
         <title level="m" xml:lang="fr">Prophécies de Merlin</title>
      </title>
   </analytic>
   <monogr>
      <title level="j">PMLA</title>
      <imprint>
         <biblScope type="vol">8</biblScope>
         <date>1913</date>
         <biblScope type="pages">122</biblScope>
      </imprint>
   </monogr>
</biblStruct></egXML>
In this case, the analytic title <q>Notes on Manuscripts of the
<title>Prophécies de Merlin</title></q> needs no <att>level</att>
attribute because it is directly contained by the <gi>analytic</gi>
level; the monographic title contained within it, <q>Prophécies
de Merlin,</q> does not create a semantic error because it is not
directly contained by the <gi>analytic</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>In some bibliographic applications, it may prove useful to
distinguish main titles from subordinate titles, parallel titles, etc.
The <att>type</att> attribute is provided to allow this distinction to
be recorded.
 </p>
<p>The following reference, from a national standard for bibliographic
references,
illustrates this type of analysis with its distinction between main
and subordinate titles. Note that this uses the more flexible
<gi>bibl</gi>, rather than the structured <gi>biblStruct</gi>
element: consequently, there is no requirement to tag all the
components of the reference (notably the authors).

 </p>
<p>Slightly more complex is the distinction made below among main,
subordinate, and parallel titles, in an example from the same source (p.
63).  The punctuation and the bibliographic analysis are those given in
ANSI Z39.29-1977; the punctuation is in the style prescribed by the
International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD).<note place="foot">The analysis is not wholly unproblematic:  as the text of the
standard points out, the first subordinate title is subordinate only to
the parallel title in French, while the second is subordinate to both
the English main title and the French parallel title, without this
relationship being made clear, either in the markup given in the example
or in the reference structure offered by the standard.</note> Again,
it is only because this example uses <gi>bibl</gi> rather than <gi>biblStruct</gi>,
that specific punctuation may be included between the component
elements of the reference.

<!-- example from ANSI Z39.29, sec. A.12.2, p.63 -->
 </p>

<p>The elements <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> have, for printed
books and articles, a fairly obvious significance; for other kinds of
bibliographic items their proper usage may be less obvious.  The
<gi>author</gi> element should be used for the person or agency with
primary responsibility for a work's intellectual content, and the
element <gi>editor</gi> for an editor of the work.  Thus an organization
such as a radio or television station is usually accounted
<soCalled>author</soCalled> of a broadcast, for example, while the
author of a Government report will usually be the agency which produced
it.
 </p>
<p>For anyone else with responsibility for the work, the
<gi>respStmt</gi> element should be used. The nature of the
responsibility is indicated by means of a <gi>resp</gi> element, and
the person, organization, etc. responsible by a <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>persName</gi>, or <gi>orgName</gi> element. Strings such as
<q>unknown</q> may be encoded using the <gi>rs</gi> element.
<!-- I'm mildly unahppy with this <rs>unknown</rs>, as it's not really a noun, is it? -sb -->
At least one of the four naming elements (<gi>name</gi>,
<gi>persName</gi>, <gi>orgName</gi>, or <gi>rs</gi>) and   one
<gi>resp</gi> element should be given within the <gi>respStmt</gi>
element, followed optionally by any number of any of them.</p>
<p>Examples of
secondary responsibility of this kind include the roles of
illustrator, translator, encoder, and annotator. The <gi>respStmt</gi>
element may also be used for editors, if it is desired to record the
specific terms in which their role is described.</p>
<p>Examples of <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may be found in
sections <ptr target="#COBITY"/>, and <ptr target="#COBICOL"/>; wherever
<gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may occur, the <gi>respStmt</gi>
element may also occur. When one of these elements precedes or
immediately follows a title, it applies to that title; when it follows
an <gi>edition</gi> element or occurs within an edition statement, it
applies to the edition in question.
 </p>
<p>In this example, the <gi>respStmt</gi> elements apply to the work as
a whole, not merely to the first edition:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COBICOR-eg-248"><bibl>

<!-- from ISO 690: 1987, clause 4.1, p. 2. -->
 </p>
<p>In this example, by contrast, the <gi>respStmt</gi> element applies
to the edition, and not to the collection per se (Moser and Tervooren
were not responsible for the first thirty-five printings); the elements
of the reference have been reordered from their appearance on the title
page of the volume in order to ensure the correct relationship of the
collection title, the edition statement, and the statement of
responsibility.

<p>Another form of <soCalled>responsibility</soCalled> arises when a
work is published as the outcome of a conference, workshop

<p>By <mentioned>imprint</mentioned> is meant all the information
relating to the publication of a work: the person or organization by
whose authority and in whose name a bibliographic entity such as a
book is made public or distributed (whether a commercial publisher or
some other organization), the place of publication, and a date.  It
may also include a full address for the publisher or organization.
Full bibliographic references usually specify either the number of
pages in a print publication (or equivalent information for non-print
materials), or the specific location of the material being cited
within its containing publication.  The following elements are
provided to hold this information: <specList><specDesc key="imprint"/><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="pubPlace"/><specDesc key="publisher"/><specDesc key="date"/><specDesc key="idno"/><specDesc key="extent"/><specDesc key="biblScope"/></specList> The elements <gi>biblScope</gi>,
<gi>pubPlace</gi> and <gi>publisher</gi> constitute the special class
<ident type="class">model.imprintPart</ident>; members of this class
may appear with a date inside an <gi>imprint</gi> element in a specific
location within a <gi>biblStruct</gi>, or alternatively, they may
appear alongside any other bibliographic component inside a <gi>bibl</gi>.
 </p>
<p>For bibliographic purposes, usually only the place (or places) of
publication are required, possibly including the name of the country,
rather than a full address; the element <gi>pubPlace</gi> is provided
for this purpose. Where however the full postal address is likely to
be of importance in identifying or locating the bibliographic item
concerned, it may be supplied and tagged using the <gi>address</gi>
element described in section <ptr target="#CONAAD"/>. Alternatively,
if desired, the <gi>rs</gi> or <gi>name</gi> elements described in
section <ptr target="#CONARS"/> may be used; this involves no claim
that the information given is either a full address or the name of a
city.
 </p>
<p>The name of the publisher of an item should be marked using the
<gi>publisher</gi> element even if the item is made public
(<soCalled>published</soCalled>) by an organization other than a
conventional publisher, as is frequently the case with technical
reports:

<p>A bibliographic description, particularly for an analytic title, will
often include some additional information specifying its location, for
example as a volume number, page number, range of page numbers, or name
or number of a subdivision of the host work.  The element
<gi>biblScope</gi> may be used to identify such information if it is
present.  Where it is desired to distinguish different classes of such
information (volume number, page number, chapter number, etc.), the
<att>type</att> attribute may be used with any convenient typology.
 </p>
<p>When the item being cited is a journal article, the
<gi>imprint</gi> element describing the issue in which it appeared
may contain <gi>biblScope</gi> elements for volume and
page numbers, together with a <gi>date</gi> element.
 </p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><biblStruct>
   <analytic>
      <author>Wrigley, E. A.</author>
      <title>Parish registers and the historian</title>
   </analytic>
   <monogr>
      <editor>Steel, D. J.</editor>
      <title>National index of parish registers</title>

      </imprint>
         </monogr>

<p>In bibliographic parlance, a <term>related item</term> is any
bibliographic item which, though related to that being defined, is
distinct from it. The distinction between analytic and monographic
items made above may be thought of as a special case  of this kind of <q>related</q>

by means of a <gi>relatedItem</gi> within the first description, which
points to the description of the source.

<div type="div4" xml:id="COBICOO"><head>Order of Components within References</head>
<p>The order of elements in <gi>bibl</gi> elements is not constrained.
 </p>
<p>In <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements, the <gi>analytic</gi> element, if
it occurs, must come first, followed by one or more <gi>monogr</gi> and
<gi>series</gi> elements, which may appear intermingled (as long as a
<gi>monogr</gi> element comes first).  Within <gi>analytic</gi>, the
title(s), author(s), editor(s), and other statements of responsibility
may appear in any order; it is recommended that all forms of the title
be given together.  Within <gi>monogr</gi>, the author, editor, and
statements of responsibility may either come first or else follow the
monographic title(s).  Following these, the elements must appear in the
following order:
<list type="simple">
<item><gi>note</gi>s on the publication (and <gi>meeting</gi> elements
describing the conference, in the case of a proceedings volume)</item>
<item><gi>edition</gi> elements, each followed by any related
<gi>editor</gi> or <gi>respStmt</gi> elements</item>
<item><gi>imprint</gi></item>
<item><gi>biblScope</gi></item></list>
Within <gi>imprint</gi>, the elements allowed may appear in any
order.</p>
<p>Finally, within the <gi>series</gi> information in a
<gi>biblStruct</gi>, the sequence of elements is not constrained.
 </p>
<p>If more detailed structuring of a bibliographic description is
required, the <gi>biblFull</gi> element should be used.  This is not
further described here, as its contents are essentially equivalent to
those of the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, which
is fully described in section <ptr target="#HD2"/>.
 </p></div></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="COBIXR"><head>Bibliographic Pointers </head>
<p>References which are pointers to bibliographic items, of whatever
kind, should be treated in the same way as other cross-references (see
section <ptr target="#COXR"/>).  As discussed in that section, cross
referencing within TEI texts is in general represented by means of
<gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> elements. A <att>target</att> attribute on
these elements is used to supply an identifying value for the target of
the cross reference, which should be, in the case of bibliographic
elements, a bibliographic reference of some kind.  Where the form of the
reference itself is unimportant, or may be reconstructed mechanically,
or is not to be encoded, the <gi>ptr</gi> element is used, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">As shown above (<ptr target="#NEL80"/>) ...</egXML>
 </p>
<p>Where the form of the reference is important, or contains additional
qualifying information which is to be kept but distinguished from the
surrounding text, the <gi>ref</gi> element should be used, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nelson claims <ref target="#NEL80">(ibid, passim)</ref> ...</egXML>
<!--Following suggestion is only possible if <biblScope> becomes a phrase. -->
	<!--Which it currently isnt.  -->
	<!--<p>When it is desired to distinguish the short form of the reference -->
	<!--itself from the additional qualifying information added to it, the -->
	<!--additional information may be marked as a <gi>biblScope</gi> element: -->
	<!--  -->
	<!--<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">-->
	<!--Nelson claims (<ref target='NEL80'>Nelson [1980], <biblScope>especially -->
	<!--pages 13&ndash;37</ref>) ... -->
	<!--]]> -->
	<!--</egXML> -->
	<!--  -->
	<!--(This distinction between the short form and the qualifying information -->
	<!--may be useful in the context of document production or normalization of -->
	<!--bibliographic references.) -->
It may be important to distinguish between the short form of a
bibliographic reference and some qualifying or additional information.
The latter should not appear within the scope of the <gi>ref</gi>
element when this is the case, as for example in an application
concerned to normalize bibliographic references:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nelson claims (<ref target="#NEL80">Nelson [1980]</ref> pages 13–37) ...</egXML>
 </p></div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="COBIOT"><head>Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes</head>

<p>The bibliographic tagging defined here can capture the distinctions
required by most bibliographic encoding systems; for the benefit of
users of some commonly used systems, the following lists of equivalences
are offered, showing the relationship of the markup defined here to the
fields defined for bibliographic records in the Scribe, BibTeX, and
ProCite systems.
 </p>
<p>Listed below are the equivalences between the various bibliographic fields
defined for use in the Scribe and BibTeX systems of bibliographic
databases and the elements defined in this module.<note place="foot">The BibTeX scheme is
intentionally compatible with that of Scribe, although it omits some
fields used by Scribe. Hence only one list of fields is given
here.</note> Elements and structures available in the module defined here which

<div type="div2" xml:id="CODV"><head>Passages of Verse or Drama</head>
<p>The following elements are included in the core module for the
convenience of those encoding texts which include mixtures of prose,
verse and drama.
<specList><specDesc key="l"/><specDesc key="lg"/><specDesc key="sp"/><specDesc key="speaker"/><specDesc key="stage"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Full details of other, more specialized, elements for the encoding of
texts which are predominantly verse or drama are described in the
appropriate chapter of part three (for verse, see the verse base
described in chapter <ptr target="#VE"/>; for performance texts, see the
drama base described in chapter <ptr target="#DR"/>).  In this section, we
describe only the elements listed above, all of which can appear in any
text, whichever of the three modes prose, verse, or drama may predominate
in it.
 </p>

<div type="div3" xml:id="COVE"><head>Core Tags for Verse</head>
<p>Like other written texts, verse texts or poems may be
hierarchically subdivided, for example into books or cantos. These
structural subdivisions should be encoded using the general purpose
<gi>div</gi> or <gi>div1</gi> (etc.) elements described below in
chapters <ptr target="#DS"/> and <ptr target="#VE"/>. The fundamental
unit of a verse text is the verse line rather than the paragraph,
however.</p>

<p>The <gi>l</gi> element is used to mark up verse lines, that is
metrical rather than typographic lines.  In some modern or free verse,
it may be hard to decide whether the typographic line is to be
regarded as a verse line or not, but the distinction is quite clear
for verse following regular metrical patterns. Where a metrical line is
interrupted by a typographic line break, the encoder may choose to
ignore the fact entirely or to use the empty <gi>lb</gi> (line break)
element discussed in <ptr target="#CORS"/>.  By convention, the start
of a metrical line implies the start of a typographic line; hence
there is no need to introduce an <gi>lb</gi> tag at the start of every
<gi>l</gi> element, but only at places where a new typographic line
starts  within a metrical line, as in the following example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-06">
<l>Of Mans First Disobedience, and<lb/> the Fruit</l>
<l>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose<lb/> mortal tast</l>
<l>Brought Death into the World,<lb/> and all our woe,</l>
<l>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</l>
<l>Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat...</l>
</egXML><!-- amusingly not COVE-eg-284 which is the Mikado -->

In the original copy text, the presence of an ornamental capital at
the start of the poem means that the measure is not wide enough to
print the first four lines on four lines; instead each metrical line occupies
two typographic lines, with a break at the point indicated. Note that
this encoding makes no attempt to preserve information about the white
space or indentation associated with either kind of line; if regarded
as essential, this information would be recorded using the
<att>rend</att> or <att>rendition</att> attributes discussed in <ptr target="#STGA"/>. </p>


<p>The <gi>l</gi> element should not be used to represent typographic
lines in non-verse materials: if the line-breaking points in a prose
text are considered important for analysis, they should be marked with
the <gi>lb</gi> element. Alternatively, a neutral segmentation element
such as <gi>seg</gi> or <gi>ab</gi> may be used; see further
discussion of these elements in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>. The
<gi>l</gi> element is a member of the <ident type="class">model.lLike</ident> class, which is a subclass of the
<ident type="class">model.divPart</ident> class, along with elements
from the <ident type="class">model.pLike</ident> (paragraph-like)
class.</p>

<p>In some verse forms, regular groupings of lines are regarded as units
of some kind, often identified by a regular verse scheme.  In stichic
verse and couplets, groups of lines analogous to paragraphs are often
indicated by indentation.  In other verse forms, lines are grouped into
irregular sequences indicated simply by white space.  The 
<gi>lg</gi> or line group element may be used to mark any such grouping
of elements from the <ident type="class">model.lLike</ident> class. As a member of the <ident type="class">att.typed</ident>
class, the <gi>lg</gi> element bears the following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.typed" atts="type subtype"/></specList>
which may be used to further categorize the
line group where this is felt desirable, as in the following example.
This example also demonstrates the <att>rend</att> attribute to indicate
whether or not a line is indented.
<!-- rhyme is only enabled if you have the verse base   -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COVE-eg-285"><lg>
   <l>Come fill up the Glass,</l>
   <l rend="indent">Round, round let it pass,</l>
   <l>'Till our Reason be lost in our Wine:</l>
   <l rend="indent">Leave Conscience's Rules</l>
   <l rend="indent">To Women and Fools,</l>
   <l>This only can make us divine.</l>

</lg></egXML>
<!-- from Gay's Beggars Opera -->
 </p>
<p>For some kinds of analysis, it may be useful to identify different
kinds of line group within the same piece of verse. Such line groups
may self-nest, in much the same way as the un-numbered <gi>div</gi>
element described in chapter <ptr target="#DS"/>. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#COVE-eg-286"><lg type="sonnet">
  <lg type="octet">
    <l>Thus speaks the Muse, and bends her brow severe:—</l>

<p>It is often the case that verse line boundaries conflict with the
boundaries of other structural elements. In the following example, the
single verse line <q>A Workeman in't... welcome</q> is interrupted by
a stage direction:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-07"><l>Thou fumblest <name>Eros</name>, and my Queenes a Squire</l>
<l>More tight at this, then thou:  Dispatch. O Loue,</l>
<l>That thou couldst see my Warres to day, and knew'st</l>
<l>The Royall Occupation, thou should'st see</l>
<l part="I">A Workeman in't. <stage>Enter an Armed Soldier.</stage>
</l>
<l part="F">Good morrow to thee, welcome. </l></egXML> 
In this encoding, the <att>part</att> attribute is used, as with
<gi>div</gi>,  to indicate that the last two <gi>l</gi> elements
should be regarded as the initial and final parts of a single line,
rather than as two lines.</p>

<p>The same technique may be used where verse lines are collected
together into units such as verse paragraphs:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CO-eg-08"><lg n="6" type="para">
<!-- ... -->
<l>Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,</l>
<l>Like a false steward who hath much received</l>
<l part="I">And renders nothing back.</l></lg>
<lg type="para" n="7">
<l part="F">Was it for this</l>
<l>That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved</l>
<l>To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,</l>
<!-- ... -->
</lg></egXML>

</p>
<p>The <att>part</att> attribute may also be attached to an <gi>lg</gi>
element to indicate that it is incomplete, for example because it forms
part of a group that is divided between two speakers, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CONONO-eg-189"><sp>
   <speaker>First Voice</speaker>
   <lg type="stanza" part="I">
      <l>But why drives on that ship so fast</l>
      <l>Withouten wave or wind?</l>
   </lg>
</sp>
<sp>
   <speaker>Second Voice</speaker>
   <lg type="stanza" part="F">
      <l>The air is cut away before,</l>
      <l>And closes from behind.</l>
   </lg>
</sp></egXML>

 </p>
<p>For alternative methods of aligning groups of lines which do not form
simple hierarchic groups, or which are discontinuous, see the more
detailed discussion in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.  For discussion of
other elements and attributes specific to the encoding of verse, see
chapter <ptr target="#VE"/>.

<div type="div3" xml:id="CODR"><head>Core Tags for Drama</head><p>Like other written texts, dramatic and other <term>performance
texts</term> such as cinema or TV scripts are often hierarchically

body of a performance text typically consists of <term rend="noindex">speeches</term>, often prefixed by a phrase indicating
who is speaking, and occasionally interspersed with stage directions
of various kinds.  </p><p>In the following simple example, each speech consists of a single

 </p>
<p>In some cases, as here in the First Quarto of <title>Hamlet</title>,
the printed speaker attributions need to be supplemented by use of the
<att>who</att> attribute; again, the lines are marked as complete or
incomplete:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CODR-eg-294"><stage>Enter two Centinels.

<p>By contrast with the preceding examples, the following encodes an
early printed edition without making any assumption about which parts
are prose or verse:

 </p>
<p>The <gi>sp</gi> and <gi>stage</gi> elements should also be used to
mark parts of a text otherwise in prose which are presented as if they
were dialogue in a play.  The following example is taken  from a 19th century
   novel in which passages of narrative and passages of dialogue are
   mixed within the same chapter:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#CODR-eg-296"><sp><speaker>The reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>

</sp>
<sp><speaker>The Reverend Doctor Opimiam</speaker>
   <p>On the contrary, sir, I think there is much to be said for him.
