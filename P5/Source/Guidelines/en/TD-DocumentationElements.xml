<head>Documentation Elements</head>
<p>This chapter describes a module which may be used for the
documentation of the XML elements and element classes which make up
any markup scheme, in particular that described by the TEI Guidelines,
and also for the automatic generation of schemas or DTDs conforming to
that documentation. It should be used also by those wishing to
customize or modify these Guidelines in a conformant manner, as
further described in chapters <ptr target="#MD"/> and <ptr target="#CF"/> and may also be useful in the documentation of any
other comparable encoding scheme, even though it contains some aspects
which are specific to the TEI and may not be generally applicable.</p>
<p>An overview of the kind of processing environment envisaged for the
module described by this chapter may be helpful. In the remainder of
this chapter we refer to software which provides such a processing
environment as an <term>ODD processor</term>.<note place="foot">ODD
is short for <q>One Document Does it all</q>, and was the name
invented by the original TEI Editors for the predecessor of the system
currently used for this purpose. See further <ptr target="#Burnard1995b"/> and <ptr target="#TD-BIBL-01"/>.</note> Like any other piece of XML software,
an ODD processor may be instantiated in many ways: the current system
uses a number of XSLT stylesheets which are freely available from the
TEI, but this specification makes no particular assumptions about the
tools which will be used to provide an ODD processing environment.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, an ODD processor uses a single XML document
to generate multiple outputs. These outputs will include:
<list type="simple">
<item>formal reference documentation for elements, attributes, element
classes, patterns, etc. such as those provided in <ptr target="#REF-ELEMENTS"/> below;</item>
<item>detailed descriptive documentation, embedding some parts of the
formal reference documentation, such as the tag description lists
provided in this and other chapters of these Guidelines;</item>
<item>declarative code for one or more XML schema languages,
specifically RELAX NG or W3C Schema.</item>
<item>declarative code for fragments which can be assembled to make up
an XML Document Type Declaration.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The input required to generate these outputs consists of running
prose, and special purpose elements documenting the components
(elements, classes, etc.) which are to be declared
in the chosen schema language. All of this input is encoded in XML
using the module defined by this chapter. In order to support more
than one schema language, this module uses a comparatively high-level
model which can then be mapped by an ODD processor to the specific
constructs appropriate to the schema language in use. Although some
modern schema languages such as RELAX NG or W3C Schema natively support
self-documentary features of this kind, we have chosen to retain the
ODD model, if only for reasons of compatibility with earlier versions
of these Guidelines. We do however use the ISO standard XML schema
language RELAX NG (<ptr target="http://www.relaxng.org"/>) as a means
of declaring content models, rather than inventing a completely new
XML-based representation for them. </p>

<p> In the TEI abstract model, a markup scheme (a <term>schema</term>)
consists of a number of discrete <term>modules</term>, which can be
combined more or less as required. Each major chapter of these
Guidelines defines a distinct module. Each module declares a number of
<term>elements</term> specific to that module, and may also populate
particular <term>classes</term>. All classes are declared globally;
particular modules extend the meaning of a class by adding elements or
attributes to it. Wherever possible, element content models are
defined in terms of classes rather than in terms of specific
elements. Modules can also declare particular <term>patterns</term>,
which act as short-cuts for commonly used content models or class
references.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, we discuss the elements needed to support
this system. In addition, section <ptr target="#TDphrase"/> discusses
some general purpose elements which may be useful in any kind of
technical documentation, wherever there is need to talk about
technical features of an XML encoding such as element names and
attributes. Section <ptr target="#TDmodules"/> discusses the elements
which are used to document XML <term>modules</term> and their
high-level components. Section <ptr target="#TDcrystals"/> discusses the
elements which document  XML elements and their attributes,
element classes, and generic patterns or macros. Finally, section <ptr target="#TDformal"/> gives an overview of the whole module.</p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="TDphrase"><head>Phrase Level Documentary
Elements</head>

<div type="div3" xml:id="TDphraseTE"><head>Phrase Level Terms</head>
<p>In any kind of technical documentation, the following phrase-level
elements may be found useful for marking up strings of text which need
to be distinguished from the running text because they come from some
formal language:
<specList>
  <specDesc key="code" atts="lang"/>
  <specDesc key="ident"/>
</specList>
Like other phrase-level elements used to indicate the semantics of a
typographically distinct string, these are members of the <ident type="class">model.emph</ident> class. They are available anywhere
that running prose is permitted when the module defined by this
chapter is included in a schema.</p>

<p>The <gi>code</gi> and <gi>ident</gi> elements are
intended for use when citing brief passages in some formal language such
as a programming language, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p>If the variable <ident>z</ident> has a value of zero, a statement 
such as <code>x=y/z</code> will usually cause a fatal error.</p>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>If the cited phrase is a mathematical or chemical formula, the more
specific <gi>formula</gi> element defined by the <ident type="module">figures</ident> module (<ptr target="#FTFOR"/>) may be
more appropriate. </p>



<p>A further group of similar phrase-level elements is also defined
for the special case of representing parts of an XML document:
<specList>
  <specDesc key="att"/>
  <specDesc key="gi"/>
  <specDesc key="tag"/>
  <specDesc key="val"/>
</specList>
These elements constitute the <ident type="class">model.phrase.xml</ident> class, which is also a subclass of <ident type="class">model.phrase</ident>. They are also available anywhere
that running prose is permitted when the module defined by this
chapter is included in a schema.
 </p>

<p>As an example of the recommended use of these elements, we quote from
an imaginary TEI working paper:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>The <gi>gi</gi> element is used to tag
element names when they appear in the text; the
<gi>tag</gi> element however is used to show how a tag as
such might appear. So one might talk of an occurrence of the
<gi>blort</gi> element which had been tagged
<tag>blort type='runcible'</tag>. The
<att>type</att> attribute may take any name token as
value; the default value is <val>spqr</val>, in memory of
its creator.</p></egXML>
 </p>


<p>Within technical documentation, it is also often necessary to
provide more extended examples of usage or to present passages of
markup for discussion. The following special elements are provided for
these purposes:
<specList> 
  <specDesc key="eg"/>
  <specDesc key="egXML"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>Like the <gi>code</gi> element, the <gi>egXML</gi> element is used
to mark strings of formal code, or passages of XML markup.  The
<gi>eg</gi> element may be used to enclose any kind of example, which
will typically be rendered as a distinct block, possibly using
particular formatting conventions, when the document is processed. It
is a specialised form of the more general <gi>q</gi> element provided
by the TEI core module. In documents containing examples of XML
markup, the <gi>egXML</gi> element should be used for preference, as
further discussed below in <ptr target="#TDeg"/>, since the content of
this element can be checked for well-formedness. </p>

<p>The global <att>xml:space</att> is available to indicate that white
space should be preserved within the content of these elements.
</p>
<p>These elements are added to the class <ident type="class">model.egLike</ident> when this module is included in a
schema. That class is a part of the general <ident type="class">model.inter</ident> class, thus permitting <gi>eg</gi> or
<gi>egXML</gi> elements to appear either within or between
paragraph-like elements. </p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TDphraseEA"><head>Element and Attribute Descriptions</head>
<p>Within the body of a document using this module, the following
elements may be used to reference parts of the specification elements
discussed in section <ptr target="#TDcrystals"/>, in particular the
brief prose descriptions these provide for elements and attributes.
<specList>
<specDesc key="specList"/>
<specDesc key="specDesc"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>TEI practice requires that a <gi>specList</gi> listing the elements
under discussion introduce each subsection of a module's
documentation. The source for the present section, for example, begins
as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div3><head>Element and attribute descriptions</head>
<p>Within the body of a document using this module, the following
elements may be used to reference parts of the specification elements
discussed in section <ptr target="#TDcrystals"/>, in particular the
brief prose descriptions these provide for elements and attributes.
<specList>
<specDesc key="specList"/>
<specDesc key="specDesc"/>
</specList></p>
<p>TEI practice requires that a <gi>specList</gi> listing the elements
...
</p><!-- ... --></div3>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>When formatting the <gi>ptr</gi> element in this example, an ODD
processor might simply generate the section number and title of the
section referred to, perhaps additionally inserting a link to the
section. In a similar way, when processing the <gi>specDesc</gi>
elements, an ODD processor must recover relevant details of the
elements being specified (<gi>specList</gi> and <gi>specDesc</gi> in
this case) from their associated declaration elements: typically, the
details recovered will include a brief description of the element and
its attributes. These, and other data, will be stored in a specification
element elsewhere within the current document, or they may be supplied by the
ODD processor in some other way, for example from a database. For this
reason, the link to the required specification element is always made
using a TEI-defined key rather than an XML IDREF value. The ODD
processor uses this key as a means of accessing the specification
element required. There is no requirement that this be performed using
the XML ID/IDREF mechanism, but there is an assumption that the
identifier be unique.</p>
<p>A <gi>specDesc</gi> generates in the documentation the identifier,
and also the contents of the <gi>desc</gi> child of whatever
specification element is indicated by its <att>key</att> attribute,
as in the example above. Documentation for any attributes specified by
the <att>atts</att> attribute will also be generated as an 
associated attribute list, .</p>
<specGrp xml:id="TDSG1" n="Phrase-level elements for tag documentation">
&att;
&code;
&eg;
&egXML;
&gi;
&ident;
&tag;
&val;
&specList;
&specDesc;
</specGrp>
</div>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="TDmodules"><head>Modules and Schemas</head>
<p>As mentioned above, the primary purpose of this module is to
facilitate the documentation and creation of an XML schema derived
from the TEI Guidelines. The following elements are provided for this
purpose:
<specList>
<specDesc key="schemaSpec"/>
<specDesc key="moduleSpec"/>
<specDesc key="moduleRef" atts="include except"/>
<specDesc key="specGrp"/>
<specDesc key="specGrpRef"/>
<specDesc key="attRef"/>
<specDesc key="elementRef"/>
</specList>

<!-- HIC DESUNT MULTA -->

A <term>module</term> is a convenient way of grouping together element
and other declarations, and associating an externally-visible name
with the resulting group. A <term>specification group</term> performs
essentially the same function, but the resulting group is not
accessible outside the scope of the ODD document in which it is
defined, whereas a module can be accessed by name from any TEI
schema. Elements, and their attributes, element classes, and
patterns are all individually documented using further elements
described in section <ptr target="#TDcrystals"/> below; part of that
specification includes the name of a module to which the component
belongs. </p>

<p>An ODD processor generating XML DTD or schema fragments from
a document marked up according to the recommendations of this chapter
will generate such fragments for each <gi>moduleSpec</gi> element
found. For example, the chapter documenting the TEI module for names
and dates contains a module specification like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> 
  <moduleSpec ident="namesdates">
  <altIdent type="FPI">Names and Dates</altIdent>
  <desc>Additional elements for names and dates</desc>
</moduleSpec>
</egXML>
together with specifications for all the elements, classes, and
patterns which make up that module, expressed using
<gi>elementSpec</gi>, <gi>classSpec</gi>, or <gi>macroSpec</gi>
elements as appropriate. (These elements are discussed in section <ptr
target="#TDcrystals"/> below.) Each of those specifications carries a
<att>module</att> attribute, the value of which is
<code>namesdates</code>. An ODD processor encountering the
<gi>moduleSpec</gi> element above can thus generate a schema fragment
for the TEI <ident type="module">namesdates</ident> module that
includes declarations for all the elements (etc.) which reference it.</p>

<p>In most realistic applications, it will be desirable to combine
more than one module together to form a complete <term>schema</term>.
A schema consists of references to one or more modules or
specification groups, and may also contain explicit declarations or
redeclarations of elements (see further <ptr target="#TDbuild"/>). Any
combination of modules can be used to create a schema <note
place="foot">The distinction between base and additional tagsets in
earlier versions of the TEI scheme has not been carried forward into
P5.</note> </p>

<p>A schema can combine references to TEI modules with references to
other (non-TEI) modules using different namespaces, for example to
include mathematical markup expressed using MathML in a TEI
document. By default, the effect of combining modules is to allow all
of the components declared by the constituent modules to coexist
(where this is syntactically possible: where it is not — for
example, because of name clashes — a schema cannot be
generated). It is also possible to over-ride declarations contained by
a module, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#TDbuild"/></p>
<p>It is often convenient to describe and operate on sets of
declarations smaller than the whole, and to document them in a
specific order: such collections are called <term>specGrps</term>
(specification groups). Individual <gi>specGrp</gi> elements are
identified using the global <att>xml:id</att> attribute, and may then
be referenced from any point in an ODD document using the
<gi>specGrpRef</gi> element. This is useful if, for example, it is
desired to describe particular groups of elements in a specific
sequence. Note however that the order in which element declarations
appear within the schema code generated from an ODD file
element is not in general affected by the order of declarations within
a <gi>specGrp</gi>. </p>
<p>An ODD processor will generate a piece of schema code
corresponding with the declarations contained by a <gi>specGrp</gi>
element in the documentation being output, and a cross-reference to
such a piece of schema code when processing a <gi>specGrpRef</gi>. For
example, if the input text reads
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>This module contains three red elements:
<specGrp xml:id="RED">
<elementSpec ident="beetroot"><!-- ... --></elementSpec>
<elementSpec ident="east"><!-- ... --></elementSpec>
<elementSpec ident="rose"><!-- ... --></elementSpec>
</specGrp>
and two blue ones:
<specGrp xml:id="BLUE">
<elementSpec ident="sky"><!-- ... --></elementSpec>
<elementSpec ident="bayou"><!-- ... --></elementSpec>
</specGrp></p>
</egXML>
then the output documentation will replace the two <gi>specGrp</gi>
elements above with a representation of the schema code declaring the
elements <gi scheme="imaginary">beetroot</gi>, <gi scheme="imaginary">east</gi>, and <gi scheme="imaginary">rose</gi> and that
declaring the elements <gi scheme="imaginary">sky</gi> and <gi scheme="imaginary">bayou</gi>
respectively. Similarly, if the input text contains elsewhere a
passage such as
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div>
<head>An overview of the imaginary module</head>
<p>The imaginary module contains declarations for coloured things:
<specGrpRef target="#RED"/>
<specGrpRef target="#BLUE"/>
</p></div></egXML>
then the <gi>specGrpRef</gi> elements may be replaced by an
appropriate piece of reference text such as <q>The RED elements were
declared in section 4.2 above</q>, or even by a copy of the relevant
declarations. As stated above, the order of declarations within the
imaginary module described above will not be affected in any
way. Indeed, it is possible that the imaginary module will contain
declarations not present in any specification group, or that the
specification groups will refer to elements that come from different
modules.  Specification groups are always local to the document in
which they are defined, and cannot be referenced externally (unlike
modules). </p>

<specGrp xml:id="TDSG2" n="Modules and Specification Groups">

&specGrp;
&specGrpRef;
&stringVal;
</specGrp>
</div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="TDcrystals"><head>Specification Elements</head>
<p>The following elements are used to declare elements,
classes, and patterns:
<specList>
<specDesc key="elementSpec"/>
<specDesc key="classSpec" atts="generate"/>
<specDesc key="macroSpec"/></specList>
 </p>
<p>Unlike most elements in the TEI scheme, each of these elements has
a fairly rigid internal structure consisting of a large number of
child elements which are always presented in the same order. For this
reason, we refer to them metaphorically as
<soCalled>crystals</soCalled>. Furthermore, since these elements all
describe markup objects in broadly similar ways, they have several
child elements in common. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss
first the elements which are common to all the specification elements,
and then those which are specific to a particular type.  </p>
<p>Specification elements may appear at any point in an ODD document,
both between and within paragraphs as well as inside a
<gi>specGrp</gi> element, but the specification element for any
particular component may only appear once (except in the case where a
modification is being defined; see further <ptr target="#TDbuild"/>). The order in which they appear will not affect
the order in which they are presented within any schema module
generated from the document. In documentation mode, however, an ODD
processor will output the schema declarations corresponding with a
specification element at the point in the text where they are
encountered, provided that they are contained by a <gi>specGrp</gi>
element, <!--. It will usually be convenient to group such declarations
together in some kind of logical sequence using the <gi>specGrp</gi>
element --> as discussed in the previous section. An ODD processor will also
associate all declarations found with the nominated module, thus
including them within the schema code generated for that module, and
it will also generate a full reference description for the object
concerned in a catalogue of markup objects. These latter two actions
always occur irrespective of whether or not the declaration is
included in a <gi>specGrp</gi>. </p>
<specGrp xml:id="TDSG3" n="Specification elements">

</specGrp>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TDcrystalsCE"><head>Common Elements</head>
<p>This section discusses the child elements common to all of the specification
elements. These child elements  are used to specify the naming, description,
exemplification, and classification of the specification elements.</p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TDcrystalsCEdc"><head>Description of Components</head>
<p><specList>
<specDesc key="remarks"/>
<specDesc key="listRef"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>One or more <gi>desc</gi> elements defined by the core module may
be used to provide a brief characterization of the intended function
of the element, class, value etc. being documented, as in the
following example:

<egXML xml:lang="mul" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="drama" ident="actor">
  <desc>Name of an actor appearing within a cast list.</desc>
  <desc xml:lang="ja"> 登場人物リスト中にある役者名を示す．</desc>
  <desc xml:lang="it">nome di un attore che appare nella lista dei personaggi.</desc>
<!-- ... --></elementSpec>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>remarks</gi> element contains any additional
commentary about how the item concerned may be used, details of
implementation-related issues, suggestions for other ways of treating
related information etc., as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><elementSpec module="core" ident="foreign">
<!--... -->
<remarks>
    <p>This element is intended for use only where no other element
is available to mark the phrase or words concerned.  The global
<att>xml:lang</att> attribute should be used in preference to this element
where it is intended to mark the language of the whole of some text
element.</p>
    <p>The <gi>distinct</gi> element may be used to identify phrases
belonging to sublanguages or registers not generally regarded as true
languages.</p>
  </remarks>
<!--... -->
</elementSpec></egXML>
</p>
<p> A specification element will usually conclude with a list of
references, each tagged using the standard <gi>ptr</gi> element, and
grouped together into a <gi>listRef</gi> element: in the case of the
<gi>foreign</gi> element discussed above, the list is as follows:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <listRef>
    <ptr target="#COHQHF"/>
  </listRef>
</egXML> where the value <val>COHQF</val> is the identifier of the
section in the Guidelines where this element is fully documented. </p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TDeg"><head>Exemplification of Components</head>
<p><specList>
<specDesc key="exemplum"/>
  <specDesc key="eg"/> 
  <specDesc key="egXML"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>exemplum</gi> element is used to combine a single
illustrative example with an optional paragraph of commentary
following or preceding it. The illustrative example itself may be
marked up using either the <gi>eg</gi> or the <gi>egXML</gi>
element.</p>
<p>If an example contains  XML markup, it should be marked up using
the <gi>egXML</gi> element. In such a case, it will clearly be necessary to
distinguish the markup within the example from the
markup of the document itself. In an XML schema environment, this is
easily done by  using a different name
space for the  <gi>egXML</gi> element. For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<p>The <gi>term</gi> element may be used 
to mark any technical term, thus :
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  This <term>recursion</term> is 
  giving me a headache.</egXML></p>
]]></eg>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the XML tagging within an example may be
<soCalled>escaped</soCalled>, either by using entity
references, or by wrapping the whole example in a CDATA marked
section:
<eg><![CDATA[<p>The <gi>term</gi> element may be used 
to mark any technical term, thus :
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  This &lt;term&gt;recursion&lt;/term&gt; is 
  giving me a headache.</egXML></p>
]]></eg>
or, equivalently:
<eg><![CDATA[<p>The <gi>term</gi> element may be used 
to mark any technical term, thus :
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
  This <term>recursion</term> is 
  giving me a headache.]]]]><![CDATA[></egXML></p>
]]></eg>
However, escaping the markup in this way will make it impossible to
validate, and should therefore generally be avoided.
</p>
<p>If the XML contained in an example is not well-formed then it must
either be enclosed in a CDATA marked section, or
<soCalled>escaped</soCalled> as above: this applies whether the
<gi>eg</gi> or <gi>egXML</gi> is used. If it is well-formed but not
valid, then it should be enclosed in a CDATA marked section within an
<gi>egXML</gi>.</p>
<p>An <gi>egXML</gi> element should not be used to tag non-XML
examples: the general purpose <gi>eg</gi> or <gi>q</gi> elements
should be used for such purposes.</p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TDcrystalsCEcl"><head>Classification of Components</head>
<p>In the TEI scheme elements are assigned to one or more
<term>classes</term>, which  may themselves have subclasses. The
following elements are used to indicate class membership:
<specList>
<specDesc key="classes"/>
<specDesc key="memberOf" atts="key"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>classes</gi> element appears within either the
<gi>elementSpec</gi> or <gi>classSpec</gi> element. It specifies the
classes of which the element or class concerned is a member by means
of one or more <gi>memberOf</gi> child elements. Each such element
references a class by means of its <att>key</att> attribute. Classes
themselves are defined by the <gi>classSpec</gi> element described in
section <ptr target="#TDCLA"/> below.</p>
<p>For example, to show that the element <gi>gi</gi> is a member of the class
<ident type="class">model.phrase.xml</ident>, the  <gi>elementSpec</gi> which documents this
element contains the following <gi>classes</gi> element:
  <egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classes>
  <memberOf key="model.phrase.xml"/>
</classes>
</egXML></p>

<specGrp xml:id="TDSG4" n="Common specification elements">

&exemplum;
&classes;

&equiv;
&altIdent;
</specGrp>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TDTAG"><head>Element Specifications</head>
<p>The <gi>elementSpec</gi> element is used to document an element type,
together with its associated attributes.  In addition to the elements
listed above, it may contain the following subcomponents:
<specList>
<specDesc key="content" atts="autoPrefix"/>
<specDesc key="attList" atts="org"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>The content of the element <gi>content</gi> may be
expressed in one of two ways. It may use a schema language of some
kind, as defined by a pattern called
<code>macro.schemaPattern</code>, which is provided by the
module defined in this
chapter. Alternatively, the legal content for an element may be fully
specified using the <gi>valList</gi> element, described in <ptr target="#TDATT"/> below. </p>
<p>In the case of the TEI
Guidelines, element content models are defined using RELAX NG
patterns, but the user may over-ride this by redefining this
pattern.</p>
<p>Here is a very simple example
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content>
    <rng:text xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"/>
  </content>
</egXML>
This content model uses the RELAX NG namespace, and will be copied
unchanged to the output when RELAX NG schemas are being generated. When
an XML DTD is being generated, an equivalent declaration (in this
case <code>(#PCDATA)</code>) will be output.</p>
<p>Here is a more complex example:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content>
    <rng:group xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
      <rng:ref name="fileDesc"/>
      <rng:zeroOrMore>
        <rng:ref name="model.teiHeaderPart"/>
      </rng:zeroOrMore>
      <rng:optional>
        <rng:ref name="revisionDesc"/>
      </rng:optional>
    </rng:group>
  </content>
</egXML>
This is the content model for the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element,
expressed in the RELAX NG syntax, which again is copied unchanged to
the output during schema generation. The equivalent DTD notation
generated from this is <code>(fileDesc, (%model.teiHeaderPart;)*,
revisionDesc?)</code>.
</p>
<p>The RELAX NG language does not formally distinguish element names,
attribute names, class names, or macro names: all names are patterns
which are handled in the same way, as the above example shows. Within
the TEI scheme, however, different naming conventions are used to
distinguish amongst the objects being named. Unqualified names
(<code>fileDesc</code>, <code>revisionDesc</code>) are always element
names. Names prefixed with <code>model.</code> or <code>att.</code>
(e.g. <ident type="class">model.teiHeaderPart</ident> and <ident
type="class">att.typed</ident>)
are always class
names. In DTD language, classes are represented by parameter entities
(<code>%model.teiHeaderPart;</code> in the above example); see further
<ptr target="#ST"/>.</p>

<p>The RELAXNG pattern names generated by an ODD processor by default
include a special prefix, the default value of which is set using the
<att>prefix</att> attribute on <gi>schemaSpec</gi>. <!--or
<gi>moduleSpec</gi> as appropriate. --> The purpose of this is to
ensure that the pattern name generated is uniquely identified as
belonging to a particular schema, and thus avoid name clashes. For
example, in a RELAXNG schema combining the TEI element <gi>ident</gi>
with another element called <gi>ident</gi> from some other vocabulary,
the former will be defined by a pattern called <code>TEI_ident</code>
rather than simply <code>ident</code>. Most of the time, this
behaviour is entirely transparent to the user; the one occasion when
it is not will be where a content model (expressed using RELAXNG
syntax) needs explicitly to reference either the TEI <gi>ident</gi> or
the other one. In such a situation, the <att>autoPrefix</att>
attribute on <gi>content</gi> may be used. For example, suppose that
we wish to define a content model for <gi>term</gi> which permits
either a TEI <gi>ident</gi> or the <gi>ident</gi> defined by some
other vocabulary.  A suitable content model would be generated from
the following <gi>content</gi> element:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"
       xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content autoPrefix="false">
<rng:choice>
<rng:ref name="TEI_ident"/>
<rng:ref name="ident"/>
</rng:choice></content>
</egXML></p>


<p>In addition to the <gi>content</gi> element, a set of identified general
<gi>constraint</gi> elements can be provided where rules about the validity of
an element can be expressed. They are identifiable in order
that a TEI customization may override, delete or change them individually.
These elements follow the <gi>content</gi>
element, are permitted as siblings of <gi>datatype</gi> in
<gi>attDef</gi>, and as children of <gi>schemaSpec</gi>.  The
constraints can be expressed in any notation which is found useful;
the scheme must be recorded using the <att>scheme</att> attribute
of <gi>constraint</gi>.</p>

<p>The TEI Guidelines themselves provide constraints using the
ISO Schematron language. These are normative, and
changes to them may affect conformance, just as for
<gi>content</gi>. Although not all processors will be
able to process all constraints, they should follow as many
as they can. </p>

<p>A complete Schematron document consists of a <gi
scheme="Schematron">schema</gi> element containing <gi
scheme="Schematron">ns</gi> and <gi scheme="Schematron">pattern</gi>
elements; each pattern specifies a rule and a context. In a normal 
TEI specification it is expected that <gi scheme="Schematron">ns</gi>
and <gi scheme="Schematron">pattern</gi> elements will be placed
wherever suitable for documentation, and extracted into a single
Schematron schema, or embedded in another schema language. As a
convenience for readers, however, TEI processors should also support
the direct placement of Schematron <gi scheme="Schematron">report</gi>
and <gi scheme="Schematron">assert</gi> elements inside the
<gi>constraint</gi> element within <gi>elementSpec</gi>; the <gi
scheme="Schematron">pattern</gi> and <gi scheme="Schematron">rule</gi>
containers should then be generated automatically.</p>

<p>Constraints are generally used to model local rules which are outside  the scope of
conventional schema languages. For example, the TEI element
<gi>relation</gi>
has a note that
<q>Only one of the attributes <att>active</att> and
<att>mutual</att> may be supplied; the attribute <att>passive</att>
may be supplied only if the attribute <att>active</att> is
supplied.</q>, which can be written in Schematron as
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <constraintSpec ident="activemutual" scheme="isoschematron"> 
    <desc>Check mutually incompatible attributes</desc>
    <constraint>
      <s:report test="@active and @mutual">Only one of the attributes
      'active' and 'mutual' may be supplied</s:report>
      <s:report test="@passive and not(@active)">the attribute 'passive'
      may be supplied only if the attribute 'active' is
      supplied</s:report>
    </constraint>
  </constraintSpec>

</egXML>
</p>
<p>We may also look at rules to apply to 
a TEI document which is going to be rendered into accessible HTML. We can check
that some sort of content is available from which the <att>alt</att>
attribute of an HTML <gi scheme="HTML">img</gi> can be created:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<constraintSpec ident="alt" scheme="isoschematron">
  <constraint> 
    <s:pattern name="Alt tags">
      <s:rule context="tei:figure">
	<s:report test="not(tei:figDesc or tei:head)"> You should
	provide information in a figure from which
	we can construct an alt attribute in HTML </s:report>
      </s:rule>
    </s:pattern>
  </constraint>
</constraintSpec>
</egXML>
or we might enforce other HTML accessibility rules about tables; note
here the use of a report and an assertion within one pattern:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<constraintSpec ident="tables" scheme="isoschematron">
<constraint>
  <s:pattern name="Tables">		
    <s:rule context="tei:table">
       <s:assert test="tei:head">A &lt;table> should have a caption, using a &lt;head> element</s:assert>
       <s:report test="parent::tei:body">Do not use tables to lay out the document body</s:report>
     </s:rule>
  </s:pattern>	
</constraint>
</constraintSpec>
</egXML>
We can also model contextual constraints in Schematron:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<constraintSpec ident="subclauses"  scheme="isoschematron">
  <constraint>
  <s:rule context="tei:div">
    <s:assert
	test="not(tei:div) or count(tei:div)&gt;1">a clause must contain
    at least two subclauses</s:assert>
  </s:rule>
  </constraint>
</constraintSpec>
</egXML>
and base requirements on attribute values:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<constraintSpec ident="introtitle"  scheme="isoschematron">
  <constraint>
  <s:assert
      test="tei:fileDesc/tei:titleStmt/tei:title[@type='introductory']">
    An introductory component of the title is expected
  </s:assert>
  </constraint>
</constraintSpec>
<constraintSpec ident="maintitle" scheme="isoschematron">
  <constraint>
    <s:assert
	test="tei:fileDesc/tei:titleStmt/tei:title[@type='main']">
      An main component of the title is expected
    </s:assert>
  </constraint>
</constraintSpec>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TDATT">
<head>Attribute List Specification</head>
<p>The <gi>attList</gi> element is used to document information about a
collection of attributes, either within an <gi>elementSpec</gi>, or within a
<gi>classSpec</gi>.  An attribute list can be organized either as a
group of attribute definitions, all of which are understood to be
available, or as a choice of attribute definitions, of which only one
is understood to be available. An attribute list may also contain
nested attribute lists.  </p>
<p>The <gi>attDef</gi> element is used to 
document a single attribute, using an appropriate
selection from the common elements already mentioned and the
following which are specific to attributes:
<specList>
<specDesc key="attDef" atts="usage"/>
<specDesc key="datatype"/>
<specDesc key="defaultVal"/>
<specDesc key="valDesc"/>
<specDesc key="valList"/>
<specDesc key="valItem"/>
</specList>
 </p>
<p>The <gi>attList</gi> within an <gi>elementSpec</gi> is used to specify
only the attributes which are specific to that particular
element. Instances of the element may carry other attributes which are
declared by the classes of which the element is a member.  These extra
attributes, which are shared by other elements, or by all elements,
are specified by an <gi>attList</gi> contained within a
<gi>classSpec</gi> element, as described in section <ptr target="#TDCLA"/> below. </p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TD-datatypes"><head>Datatypes</head>
<p>The <gi>datatype</gi> element is used to state what kind of value
an attribute may have, using whatever facilities are provided by the
underlying  schema language. For the TEI scheme, expressed in
RELAX NG, elements from the RELAX NG namespace may be used, for example
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><datatype>
  <rng:text xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"/>
</datatype></egXML>
permits any string of Unicode characters not containing markup, and is
thus the equivalent of <code>CDATA</code> in DTD language. 
</p>
<p>The RELAX NG language also provides support for a number of
primitive datatypes which may be specified here, using the
<gi>rng:data</gi> element: thus one may write
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><datatype>
  <rng:data xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" type="boolean"/>
</datatype></egXML>
to specify that an element or attribute's contents should conform to
the W3C definition for <code>boolean</code>.</p>
<p>Although only one child element may be given, this might be a
selector such as <val>rng:choice</val> to indicate multiple
possibilities:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><datatype>
<rng:choice xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
  <rng:data type="Date"/>
  <rng:data type="Float"/>
</rng:choice>
</datatype></egXML>
which would permit either a date or a real number. In fact, the child
element might be a <code>rng:list</code> element to indicate that a
sequence of values is required, a <code>rng:param</code> element to
specify a regular expression, or even a list of explicit
<code>rng:value</code>s. Such usages are permitted by the scheme
documented here, but are not recommended when it is desired to remain
independent of a particular schema language, since the full generality
of one schema language cannot readily be converted to that of
another. In the TEI abstract model, datatyping should preferably be
carried out either by explicit enumeration of permitted values (using
the TEI-specific <gi>valList</gi> element described below), or by
definition of an explicit pattern, using the TEI-specific
<gi>macroSpec</gi> element discussed further in section <ptr target="#TDENT"/>.</p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TDATTvs"><head>Value Specification</head>
<p>The <gi>valDesc</gi> element may be used to describe 
constraints on data content in an informal way: for example
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valDesc>must point to another <gi>align</gi>
    element logically preceding this
    one.</valDesc></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valDesc>Values should be Library of Congress subject
headings.</valDesc></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valDesc>A bookseller's surname,
 taken from the list in <title>Pollard and Redgrave</title></valDesc></egXML>
</p>
<p>As noted above, the <gi>datatype</gi> element 
constrains  the
possible values for an attribute. The <gi>valDesc</gi> element can be used to
describe further constraints. For example, to specify that an attribute
<att>age</att> can take positive integer values less than 100, the
datatype <ident type="datatype">data.numeric</ident> might be used in combination with
a <gi>valDesc</gi> such as <q>values must be positive integers less
than 100</q>. </p>
<p>More usually, however, where constraints on values are explicitly
enumerated, the <gi>valList</gi> element is used, as in the
following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><valList type="closed">
  <valItem ident="req"><gloss>required</gloss></valItem>
  <valItem ident="mwa"><gloss>mandatory when applicable</gloss></valItem>
  <valItem ident="rec"><gloss>recommended</gloss></valItem>
  <valItem ident="rwa"><gloss>recommended when applicable</gloss></valItem>
  <valItem ident="opt"><gloss>optional</gloss></valItem>
 </valList>
</egXML>
Since this value list specifies that it is of type <val>closed</val>,
only the values enumerated and glossed above are legal, and an ODD
processor will typically enforce these constraints in the schema
fragment generated. </p>
<p>The <gi>valList</gi> element is also used to provide illustrative examples
of the kinds of values expected. In such cases
the <att>type</att> attribute will have the value <val>open</val> and
the datatype will usually be <ident type="datatype">data.enumerated</ident>.</p>


<p>Note that the <gi>gloss</gi> element is needed to explain the
significance of the identifier for an item only when this is not
apparent, for example because it is abbreviated, as in the above
example. It should  not be used to provide a full description of the
intended meaning (this is the function of the <gi>desc</gi> element),
nor to comment on equivalent values in other schemes (this is the
purpose of the <gi>equiv</gi> element), nor to provide alternative
versions of the <att>ident</att> attribute value in other languages
(this is the purpose of the <gi>altIdent</gi> element).</p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="TDATTex"><head>Examples</head>
<p>The following <gi>attList</gi> demonstrates some of the
possibilities; for more detailed examples, consult the tagged version of
the reference material in these Guidelines.
<!-- replace this example if we change the definition of gloss list!  -->

           the list item.</desc>
        </valItem>
      </valList>
      <remarks>
        <p>The formal syntax of the element declarations allows
        <gi>label</gi> tags to be omitted from lists tagged <tag>list
        type="gloss"</tag>; this is however a semantic error.</p>
      </remarks>
    </attDef>
  </attList> </egXML>
 </p>
<p>In the following example, the <att>org</att> attribute is used to
indicate that instances of the element concerned may bear either a
<att scheme="imaginary">bar</att> attribute or a <att
scheme="imaginary">baz</att> attribute, but not both. The <att
scheme="imaginary">bax</att> attribute is always available: <egXML xml:lang="und"

</div>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="TDCLA"><head>Element Classes</head>

<p>The element <gi>classSpec</gi> is used to document an <term>element
class</term> or <soCalled>class</soCalled>, as defined in section <ptr target="#STEC"/>.  It has the following components, additional to
those already mentioned:
<specList>
<specDesc key="classSpec" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="attList"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>A class specification does not list all of its members. Instead,
its members declare that they belong to it by means of a
<gi>classes</gi> element contained within the relevant
<gi>elementSpec</gi>. This will contain a <gi>memberOf</gi> element
for each class of which the relevant element is a member, supplying
the name of the relevant class. For example, the <gi>elementSpec</gi>
for the element <gi>hi</gi> contains the following: <egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classes>
  <memberOf key="model.hiLike"/>
</classes>
</egXML>
This  indicates that the <gi>hi</gi> element is a member of the class
with identifier <ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident>. The
<gi>classSpec</gi> element that documents this class contains
the following declarations:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classSpec type="model" ident="model.hiLike">
<desc>groups phrase-level elements related to highlighting that have
no specific semantics </desc>
  <classes>
    <memberOf key="model.highlighted"/>
  </classes>
</classSpec>
</egXML>
which indicate that the class <ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident>
is actually a member (or subclass) of the class <ident type="class">model.highlighted</ident>.
 </p>

<p>The attribute <att>type</att> is used to distinguish between
<soCalled>model</soCalled> and <soCalled>attribute</soCalled>
classes. In the case of attribute classes, the attributes provided by 
membership in the class are documented by an <gi>attList</gi> element
contained within the <gi>classSpec</gi>. In the case of model classes,
no further information is neeeded to define the class beyond its
description, its identifier, and optionally any classes of which it is
a member. </p>

<p>When a model class is referenced in the content model of an element
(i.e. in the <gi>content</gi> of an <gi>elementSpec</gi>), its meaning
will depend on the name used to reference the class. </p>

<p>If the reference simply takes the form of the class name, it is
interpreted to mean an alternated list of all the current members of
the class. For example, suppose that the members of the class <ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident> are elements <gi>hi</gi>,
<gi scheme="imaginary">it</gi>, and <gi scheme="imaginary">bo</gi>. Then a content model such as <egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content>
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
   <rng:ref name="model.hiLike"/>
</rng:zeroOrMore></content></egXML>
would be equivalent to the explicit content model:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content>
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
   <rng:choice>
     <rng:ref name="hi"/>
     <rng:ref name="it"/>
     <rng:ref name="bo"/>
   </rng:choice>
</rng:zeroOrMore></content></egXML> (or, to use RELAX NG compact
syntax, <code>(hi|it|bo)*</code>). However, a content model
referencing the class as <ident type="class">model.hiLike_sequence</ident> would be
equivalent to the following explicit content model: <egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><content>
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <rng:ref name="hi"/>
     <rng:ref name="it"/>
     <rng:ref name="bo"/>
</rng:zeroOrMore></content></egXML> (or, in RELAX NG compact syntax,
<code>(hi,it,bo)*</code>. </p>
<p>The following suffixes, appended with an underscore, can be given to a class name when it is
referenced in a content model:
      <list type="gloss">
        <label>alternation</label>
          <item>members of the class are alternatives</item>
        <label>sequence</label>
          <item>members of the class are to be provided in sequence</item>
        <label>sequenceOptional</label>
          <item>members of the class may be provided, in sequence,
	    but are optional</item>
        <label>sequenceOptionalRepeatable</label>
          <item>members of the class may be provided one or more
	    times, in sequence, but are optional. </item>
        <label>sequenceRepeatable</label>
          <item>members of the class must be provided one or more times, in sequence</item>
      </list>
</p>
<p>Thus a reference to
<ident type="class">model.hiLike_sequenceOptional</ident> in a content model would be equivalent to:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <rng:optional><rng:ref name="hi"/></rng:optional>
     <rng:optional><rng:ref name="it"/></rng:optional>
     <rng:optional><rng:ref name="bo"/></rng:optional>
</rng:zeroOrMore></egXML>
A reference to  <ident type="class">model.hiLike_sequenceRepeatable</ident>  would however be equivalent to:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <rng:oneOrMore><rng:ref name="hi"/></rng:oneOrMore>
     <rng:oneOrMore><rng:ref name="it"/></rng:oneOrMore>
     <rng:oneOrMore><rng:ref name="bo"/></rng:oneOrMore>
</rng:zeroOrMore></egXML> and a reference to <ident type="class">model.hiLike_sequenceOptionalRepeatable</ident> would be equivalent to:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <rng:zeroOrMore><rng:ref name="hi"/></rng:zeroOrMore>
     <rng:zeroOrMore><rng:ref name="it"/></rng:zeroOrMore>
     <rng:zeroOrMore><rng:ref name="bo"/></rng:zeroOrMore>
</rng:zeroOrMore></egXML></p>

<p>The <soCalled>sequence</soCalled> in which members of a class
appear in a content model when one of the sequence options is used is
that in which the elements are declared. </p>

<p>In principal, all these possibilities are available to any element
making reference to any class. The <gi>classSpec</gi> element defining
the class may however limit the possibilities by means of its
<att>generate</att> attribute, which can be used to say that this
particular model may only be referenced in a content model with the
suffixes it specifies. For example, if the <gi>classSpec</gi> for
<ident type="class">model.hiLike</ident> took the form <tag>classSpec
ident="model.hiLike" generateOnly="sequence sequenceOptional"</tag>
then a content model referring to (say) <ident
type="class">model.hiLike_sequenceRepeatable</ident> would be regarded
as invalid by an ODD processor. </p>


<p>When a <gi>classSpec</gi> contains an <gi>attList</gi> element, all
the members of that class inherit the attributes specified by it. For
example, the class <ident type="class">att.interpLike</ident> defines
a small set of attributes common to all elements which are members of
that class: those attributes are listed by the <gi>attList</gi>
element contained by the <gi>classSpec</gi> for <ident type="class">att.interpLike</ident>. When processing the documentation
elements for elements which are members of that class, an ODD
processor is required to extend the <gi>attList</gi> (or equivalent)
for such elements to include any attributes defined by the
<gi>classSpec</gi> elements concerned.  There is a single global
attribute class, <ident type="class">att.global</ident>, to which some
modules contribute additional attributes when they are included in a
schema. </p>

<p>As noted above, a TEI schema is defined by a <gi>schemaSpec</gi>
element containing an arbitrary mixture of explicit declarations for
objects (i.e. elements, classes, patterns, or macro specifications)
and references to other objects containing such declarations
(i.e. references to specification groups, or to modules). A major
purpose of this mechanism is to simplify the process of defining user
customizations, by providing a formal method for the user to combine
new declarations with existing ones, or to modify particular parts of
existing declarations.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, a user-defined schema might simply combine
all the declarations from two nominated modules:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec ident="example">
<moduleRef key="core"/>
<moduleRef key="linking"/>
</schemaSpec></egXML> An ODD processor, given such a document, should
combine the declarations which belong to the named modules, and
deliver the result as a schema of the requested type. It may also
generate documentation for the elements declared by those
modules. No source is specified for the modules, and the schema will
therefore combine the declarations found in the most recent release
version of the TEI Guidelines known to the ODD processor in use. 
<egXML xml:lang="und"
       xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec
						    ident="example" source="http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/odd/Source/Guidelines/fr/guidelines-en.xml">
<moduleRef key="core"/>
<moduleRef key="linking"/>
</schemaSpec></egXML>
would have a similar effect, except that the French language source for the
most recent version of the Guidelines would be used instead.</p>

<p>The value for the <att>source</att> attribute may be a specific URL
as in the preceding example, or any other form of URI. A set of
TEI-conformant specifications in a form directly usable by an ODD
processor must be available at the location indicated. When no
<att>source</att> value is supplied, an ODD processor may either raise
an error or assume that the location of the current release of the TEI
Guidelines is intended.</p>
<p>If the source is specified in the form of a private URI,
the form recommended is <code>tei:x.y.z</code>, where
<code>x.y.z</code> indicates the version number,
e.g. <code>tei:5.1</code> for the most recent version of P5 release 1,
or <code>tei:5.2.11</code> for release 2.1.1 of P5. When such a
URI is used, it may be necessary to  remove or translate it before
such a file can be used in blind interchange. 
</p>
<p>The effect of a <gi>moduleRef</gi> element is to include in the
schema all declarations provided by that module. This may be modified
by means of the attributes <att>include</att> and <att>except</att>
which allow the encoder to supply an explicit lists of elements from
the stated module which are to be included or excluded
respectively. For example:
<egXML xml:lang="und"
       xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec
						    ident="example" >
<moduleRef key="core" except="add del orig reg"/>
<moduleRef key="linking" include="ptrGroup link"/>
</schemaSpec></egXML>
The schema specified here will include all the elements supplied by
the core module except for <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, <gi>orig</gi>,
and <gi>reg</gi>. It will also include only the <gi>ptrGroup</gi> and
<gi>link</gi>  elements from the linking module. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the element <gi>elementRef</gi> may  be used
to indicate explicitly which elements are to be included in a
schema. The same effect as the preceding example might thus be
achieved by the following:
<egXML xml:lang="und"
       xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec
						    ident="example" >
<moduleRef key="core" except="add del orig reg"/>
<elementRef key="ptrGroup" />
<elementRef key="link"/>
</schemaSpec></egXML>
Note that in this last case, there is no need to specify the name of
the module from which the two element declarations are to be found; in
the TEI scheme, element names are unique across all modules. The
module is simply a convenient way of grouping together a number of
related declarations.
</p>
<p>A schema may also include declarations for new elements, as in
the following example:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec ident="example">
<moduleRef key="teiheader"/>
<moduleRef key="verse"/>
<elementSpec ident="soundClip">
<classes><memberOf key="model.pPart.data"/></classes>
</elementSpec>
</schemaSpec></egXML> A declaration for the element
<gi scheme="imaginary">soundClip</gi>, which is not defined in the TEI scheme, will be
added to the output schema. This element will also be added to the
existing TEI class <ident type="class">model.pPart.data</ident>, and
will thus be available in TEI conformant documents.</p>
<p>A schema might also include re-declarations of existing elements, as
in the following example:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><schemaSpec ident="example">
<moduleRef key="teiheader"/>
<moduleRef key="teistructure"/>
<elementSpec ident="head" mode="change">
<content><rng:ref xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" name="macro.xtext"/></content>
</elementSpec>
</schemaSpec>
</egXML>
The effect of this is to redefine the content model for the element
<gi>head</gi> as plain text, by over-riding the <gi>content</gi> child
of the selected <gi>elementSpec</gi>. The attribute specification
<code>mode="change"</code> has the effect of over-riding only those
children elements of the <gi>elementSpec</gi> which appear both in the
original specification and in the new specification supplied above:
<gi>content</gi> in this example. Note that if the value for
<att>mode</att> were <val>replace</val>, the effect would be to
replace all children elements of the original specification with the 
the children elements of the new specification, and thus (in this
example) to delete all of them except <gi>content</gi>. </p>

<p>A schema may not contain more than two declarations for any given
component. The value of the <att>mode</att> attribute is used to
determine exactly how the second declaration (and its constituents)
should be combined with the first. The following table summarizes how
a processor should resolve duplicate declarations; the term
<term>identifiable</term> refers to those elements which can have a
<att>mode</att> attribute:
<table>
<row role="label">
<cell>mode value</cell>
<cell>existing declaration</cell>
<cell>effect</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>add</cell>
<cell>no</cell>
<cell>add new declaration to schema; process its children in add mode</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>add</cell>
<cell>yes</cell>
<cell>raise error</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>replace</cell>
<cell>no</cell>
<cell>raise error</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>replace</cell>
<cell>yes</cell>
<cell>retain existing declaration; process new children in replace
mode; ignore existing children</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>change</cell>
<cell>no</cell>
<cell>raise error</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>change</cell>
<cell>yes</cell>
<cell>process identifiable children according to their modes;
process unidentifiable children in replace mode; 
retain existing children where no replacement or change
is provided </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>delete</cell>
<cell>no</cell>
<cell>raise error</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>delete</cell>
<cell>yes</cell>
<cell>ignore existing declaration and its children</cell>
</row>
</table>

<div type="div3" xml:id="ST-aliens"><head>Combining TEI and Non-TEI Modules</head>

<p>In the simplest case, all that is needed to include a non-TEI
module in a schema is to reference its RELAX NG source using the
<att>url</att> attribute on <gi>moduleRef</gi>. The following 
specification, for example, creates a schema in which declarations
from the non-TEI module <ident type="file">svg11.rng</ident> (defining Standard
Vector Graphics) are included. To avoid any risk of name clashes, the
schema specifies that all TEI patterns generated should be prefixed by
the string "TEI_".
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <schemaSpec prefix="TEI_" ident="testsvg" start="TEI svg">
      <moduleRef key="header"/>
      <moduleRef key="core"/>
      <moduleRef key="tei"/>
      <moduleRef key="textstructure"/>
      <moduleRef url="svg11.rng"/>
    </schemaSpec></egXML>
</p>

<p>This specification generates a single schema which might be used to
validate either a TEI document (with the root element <gi>TEI</gi>),
or an SVG document (with a root element <gi>svg:svg</gi>), but would
<emph>not</emph> validate a TEI document containing <gi>svg:svg</gi>
or other elements from the SVG language. For that to be possible, the
<gi>svg:svg</gi> element must become a member of a TEI model class
(<ptr target="#STEC"/>), so that it may be referenced by other TEI
elements. To achieve this, we modify the last <gi>moduleRef</gi> in
the above example as follows:
<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <moduleRef url="svg11.rng">
	<content xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
	  <rng:define name="TEI_model.graphicLike" combine="choice">
	    <rng:ref name="svg"/>
	  </rng:define>
	</content>
      </moduleRef>
</egXML></p>
<p>This states that when the declarations from the
<ident type="file">svg11.rng</ident> module are combined with those from the other
modules, the declaration for the model class model.graphicLike in the TEI module
should be extended to include the element <gi>svg:svg</gi> as an
alternative. This has the effect that elements in the TEI scheme
which define their content model in terms of that element class
(notably <gi>figure</gi>) can now include it. A RELAX NG schema
generated from such a specification can be used to validate documents
in which the TEI <gi>figure</gi> element contains any valid SVG
representation of a graphic, embedded within an <gi>svg:svg</gi> element.

<div type="div2" xml:id="TDformal"><head>Module for Documention Elements</head>

<p>The module described in this chapter makes available the following
components:
<moduleSpec xml:id="DTDDTD" ident="tagdocs">
<altIdent type="FPI">Documentation Elements</altIdent>
<desc>Documentation of TEI modules</desc>

<desc xml:lang="it">Documentazione dei moduli TEI</desc><desc xml:lang="pt">Documentação dos módulos TEI</desc><desc xml:lang="ja">タグ定義モジュール</desc></moduleSpec>

The selection and combination of modules to form a TEI schema is described in
<ptr target="#STIN"/>.
</p>
<p>The elements described in this chapter are all members of one of
three classes: <ident type="class">model.oddDecl</ident>, <ident type="class">model.oddRef</ident>, or <ident type="class">model.phrase.xml</ident>, with the exceptions of
<gi>schemaSpec</gi> (a member of <ident type="class">model.divPart</ident>)
and both <gi>eg</gi> and <gi>egXML</gi> (members of <ident type="class">model.common</ident> and <ident type="class">model.egLike</ident>). All of these classes are
declared along with the other general TEI classes, in the basic
structure module documented in <ptr target="#ST"/>. </p>

<p>In addition, some elements are members of the
<ident type="class">att.identified</ident> class, which is documented in <ptr target="#TDbuild"/> above, and make use of the
<code>macro.schemaPattern</code> pattern, which is documented in <ptr target="#TDTAG"/> above.
