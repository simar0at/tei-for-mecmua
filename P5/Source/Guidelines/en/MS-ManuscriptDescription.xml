<head>Manuscript Description</head>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msov">
<head>Overview</head>

<p>This module<note place="foot">This chapter is based on the work of
the European MASTER (Manuscript Access through Standards for
Electronic Records) project, funded by the European Union from January
1999 to June 2001, and led by Peter Robinson, then at the Centre for
Technology and the Arts at De Montfort University, Leicester
(UK). Significant input also came from a TEI Workgroup headed by
Consuelo W. Dutschke of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia
University (USA) and Ambrogio Piazzoni of the Biblioteca Apostolica
Vaticana (IT) during 1998-2000.</note> defines a special purpose
element which can be used to provide detailed descriptive information
about handwritten primary sources.  Although originally developed to
meet the needs of cataloguers and scholars working with medieval
manuscripts in the European tradition, the scheme presented here is
general enough that it can also be extended to other traditions and
materials, and is potentially useful for any kind of inscribed
artefact.</p>
<p>The scheme described here is also intended to accommodate the needs of
many different classes of encoders. On the one hand, encoders may be
engaged in <term>retrospective conversion</term> of existing detailed
descriptions and catalogues into machine tractable form; on the other,
they may be engaged in cataloguing <foreign>ex nihilo</foreign>, that
is, creating new detailed descriptions for materials never before
catalogued. Some may be primarily concerned to
represent accurately the description itself, as opposed to the ideas
and interpretations the description represents; others may have
entirely opposite priorities. At one
extreme, a project may simply wish to capture an existing catalogue in
a form that can be displayed on the Web, and which can be searched for
literal strings, or for such features such as titles, authors and
dates; at the other, a project may wish to create, in highly structured
and encoded form, a detailed database of information about the physical
characteristics, history, interpretation, etc. of the material, able
to support practitioners of <term>quantitative codicology</term> as
well as librarians.</p>
<p>To cater for this diversity, here as elsewhere, these Guidelines
propose a flexible approach, in which encoders must choose for
themselves the degree of prescription appropriate to their needs, and
are provided with a choice of encoding mechanisms to support those
differing degrees.</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msdesc">
<head>The Manuscript Description Element</head>
<p>The <gi>msDesc</gi> element will normally appear within the
<gi>sourceDesc</gi> element of the header of a TEI conformant
document, where the document being encoded is a digital representation
of some manuscript original, whether as an encoded transcription, as a
collection of digital images (as described in <ptr target="#PHFAX"/>),
or as some combination of the two. However, in cases where the
document being encoded is essentially a collection of manuscript
descriptions, the <gi>msDesc</gi> element may be used in the same way
as the bibliographic elements (<gi>bibl</gi>, <gi>biblFull</gi>, and
<gi>biblStruct</gi>) making up the TEI element class <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident>. These typically appear within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msDesc"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>msDesc</gi> element has the following components,
which provide more detailed information under a number of
headings. Each of these component elements is further described in the
remainder of this chapter. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
<specDesc key="head"/>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="physDesc"/>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="additional"/>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The first of these components, <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, is the only
one which is mandatory; it is described in more detail in <ptr target="#msid"/> below. It is followed optionally by one or more
<gi>head</gi> elements, each holding a brief heading (see <ptr target="#msdo"/>), and then either one or more paragraphs, marked up
as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements, or one or more of the specialized
elements <gi>msContents</gi> (<ptr target="#msco"/>),
<gi>physDesc</gi> (<ptr target="#msph"/>), <gi>history</gi> (<ptr target="#mshy"/>), and <gi>additional</gi> (<ptr target="#msad"/>).
These elements are all optional, but if used they must appear in the
order given here.  Finally, in the case of a composite manuscript, a
full description may also contain one or more <gi>msPart</gi> elements
(<ptr target="#mspt"/>).</p>



<p>To demonstrate the use of this module, consider the following
sample manuscript description, chosen more or less at random from the
Bodleian Library's <title level="m">Summary catalogue</title> (<ptr target="#MS-eg-001"/>)
<figure corresp="#MS-eg-001">
<graphic width="450px" url="Images/MSadda61.png"/>
<head>Entry for Bodleian MS. Add. A. 61 in Madan et al.
    1895-1953</head>
</figure>
</p>

<p>The simplest way of digitizing this catalogue entry would simply be
to key in the text, tagging the relevant parts of it which make up
the mandatory <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#MS-eg-001">
<msDesc>
<msIdentifier>

</msIdentifier>
<p>In Latin, on parchment: written in more than one hand of the 13th
cent. in England: 7¼ x 5⅜ in., i + 55 leaves, in double columns: with
a few coloured capitals.</p>
<p>'Hic incipit Bruitus Anglie,' the De origine et gestis Regum

'hanauilla' is written at the foot of the page (15th cent.).  Bought
from the rev. W. D. Macray on March 17, 1863, for £1 10s.</p>
</msDesc></egXML>
With a suitable stylesheet, this encoding would be as readable as the
original; it would not, however, be very useful for search purposes
since only shelfmarks and other identifiers are distinguished. To
improve on this, one might wrap the paragraphs in the appropriate
special-purpose first-child-level elements of <gi>msDesc</gi> and add
some of the phrase-level elements available when the manuscript
description module is in use:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="#MS-eg-001">

   £1 10s.</p>
</history>
   </msDesc>
</egXML>
Note that in this version the text has been slightly reorganized, but
no actual rewriting has been necessary. The encoding now allows the
user to search for such features as title, material, and date and
place of origin; it is also possible to distinguish quoted material
from descriptive passages and to search within descriptions relating
to a particular topic (for example, history as distinct from
material).</p>
        
<p>This process could be continued further, restructuring the whole
entry so as to take full advantage of many more of the encoding
possibilities provided by the module described in this chapter:

<specGrp xml:id="msdesc.def">








&msDesc;



</specGrp>

</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msphrase">
<head>Phrase-level Elements</head>
<p>When the msdescription module is in use, several extra elements are added to
the phrase level class, and thus become available within paragraphs
and elsewhere in the document. These elements are listed below in
alphabetical order:
<specList>
<specDesc key="catchwords"/>
<specDesc key="dimensions"/>
<specDesc key="heraldry"/>
<specDesc key="locus"/>
<specDesc key="material"/>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
<specDesc key="secFol"/>
<specDesc key="signatures"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Within a manuscript description, many other
standard TEI phrase level elements are available, notably those
described in the Core module (<ptr target="#CO"/>). Additional elements
of particular relevance to manuscript description, such as those for
names and dates, may also be made available by including the relevant
module in one's schema.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msdates">
<head>Origination</head>
<p>The following elements may be used to provide information about the
origins of any aspect of a manuscript:
<specList><specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> elements are
specialized forms of the existing <gi>date</gi> and <gi>name</gi>
elements respectively, used to indicate specifically the date and
place of origin of a manuscript or manuscript part. Such information
would normally be encoded within the <gi>history</gi> element,
discussed in section <ptr target="#mshy"/>. <gi>origDate</gi> and
<gi>origPlace</gi> can also be used to identify the place or date of
origin of any aspect of the manuscript, such as its decoration or
binding, when these are not of the same date as the manuscript
itself. Both these elements are members of the
<ident type="class">att.editLike</ident> class, from which they inherit the
following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.editLike"/></specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> element is a member of the
<ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, and may thus also carry the following
attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.datable"/></specList></p>

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmat">
<head>Material</head>
<p>The <gi>material</gi> element can be used to tag any specific term
used for the physical material of which a manuscript (or binding, seal, etc.)
is composed.
<specList>
<specDesc key="material"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The element may appear wherever a term regarded as significant by
the encoder occurs, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding>
<p>Brown <material>calfskin</material>, previously with two clasps.</p>
</binding>
</egXML>

</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mswat"><head>Watermarks and Stamps</head>
<p>Two further elements are provided to
mark up other decorative features characteristic of manuscript leaves and
bindings:
<specList>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="stamp"/>
</specList></p>
<p>These element may appear
wherever a term regarded as significant by the encoder occurs. The
<gi>watermark</gi> element is most likely to be of use within the
<gi>support</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1sup"/>
below. We give a simple example here: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><support><material>Rag
paper</material> with <watermark>anchor</watermark>
watermark</support></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>stamp</gi> element will typically appear when text from the source
is being transcribed, for example within a rubric in the following case:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rubric>Apologyticu TTVLLIANI AC IGNORATIA IN XPO IHV<lb/>
SI NON LICET<lb/>
NOBIS RO<lb/>
manii imperii <stamp>Bodleian stamp</stamp><lb/></rubric></egXML>
</p>
<p>It may also appear as part of the detailed description of a binding:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding><p>Modern calf recasing with original armorial stamp <stamp>Ex
Bibliotheca J. Richard D.M.</stamp></p></binding>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msdim">
<head>Dimensions</head>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element can be used to specify the size of
some aspect of the manuscript, and thus may be thought of as a
specialized form of the existing TEI <gi>measure</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="dimensions" atts="type"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element will normally occur within the
element describing the particular feature or aspect of a manuscript
whose dimensions are being given; thus the size of the leaves would be
specified within the <gi>support</gi> or <gi>extent</gi> element (part
of the <gi>physDesc</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1"/>),
while the dimensions of other specific parts of a manuscript, such as
accompanying materials, binding, etc., would be given in other parts
of the description, as appropriate. </p>
<p>The following three elements are available within the <gi>dimensions</gi> element:
<specList>
<specDesc key="height"/>
<specDesc key="width"/>
<specDesc key="depth"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>These three elements, as well as <gi>dimensions</gi> itself, are
all members of the <ident type="class">att.dimensions</ident> class,
and thus all carry the following attributes: <specList><specDesc
key="att.dimensions" atts="scope extent unit quantity atLeast atMost min max
extent">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>Attributes <att>min</att> and <att>max</att> are used only when the
measurement applies to several items, for example the size of all
leaves in a manuscript; attributes <att>atLeast</att> and
<att>atMost</att> are used when the measurement applies to a single
item, for example the size of a  specific codex  but has had to be
estimated. Attribute <gi>quantity</gi> is used when the measurement
can be given exactly, and applies to a single item; this is the usual
situation.  The units in which dimensions are measured should always
be specified using the <att>unit</att> attribute, which will normally
take from a closed set of values appropriate to the project, using
standard units of measurement wherever possible, such as 
following values:
<val>cm</val>, 
<val>mm</val>,
<val>in</val>,
<val>line</val>,
<val>char</val>. If the only data available for the measurement uses
some other unit, or it is preferred to normalize it in some other way,
then it may be supplied as a string value using the
<att>extent</att> attribute.
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, only the <att>extent</att> attribute may be
supplied: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width
extent="6 cubit">six cubits</width></egXML> 
More usually, the measurement will be normalised into a value 
and an appropriate SI unit: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width quantity="270" unit="cm">six cubits</width></egXML>
Where the exact value is uncertain, the attributes <att>atLeast</att>
and <att>atMost</att> may be used to indicate the upper and lower
bounds of an estimated value:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width atLeast="250"
						       atMost="300" unit="cm">six cubits</width></egXML>
</p>

<p>It is often convenient to supply a measurement which applies to a
number of discrete observations: for example, the number of ruled
lines on the pages of a manuscript (which may not all be the same), or
the diameter of an object like a bell, which will differ depending
where it is measured. In such cases, the <att>scope</att> attribute
may be used to specify the observations for which this measurement is
applicable:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><height unit="line"
							scope="most"
							atLeast="20"/>
</egXML>
This indicates that most pages have at least 20 lines. The attributes
<att>min</att> and <att>max</att> can also be used to specify the possible
range of values: for example, to show that  all pages have between 12 
and 30 lines: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><height unit="line"
scope="all" min="12" max="30"/>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element may be repeated as often as
necessary, with appropriate attribute values to indicate the nature
and scope of the measurement concerned. For example, in the following
case the leaf size and ruled space of the leaves of the manuscript are
specified:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<dimensions type="ruled" unit="mm">
 <height scope="most"  quantity="90" unit="mm"/>
 <width scope="most" quantity="48" unit="mm"/>
</dimensions>
<dimensions type="leaves">
 <height min="157" max="160"  unit="mm"/>
 <width quantity="105"/>
</dimensions>
</egXML>
This indicates that for most leaves of the manuscript being described
the ruled space is 90 mm high and 48 mm wide, while the leaves throughout 
are between 157 and 160 mm in height and 105 mm in width.</p>



</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msloc"><head>References to Locations within a Manuscript</head>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is a specialized form of the <gi>ref</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="locus" atts="from to scheme"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is used to specify the location in the
manuscript occupied by the element within which it appears. If, for
example, it is used as the first component of a <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
element, or of any of the more specific elements appearing within one
(see further section <ptr target="#msco"/> below) then it is understood
to specify the location of that item within the manuscript being
described.</p>
<p>A <gi>locus</gi> element can be used to identify any reference to
one or more folios within a manuscript, wherever such a reference is
appropriate. Locations are conventionally specified as a sequence of
folio or page numbers, but may also be a discontinuous list, or a
combination of the two. This specification should be given as the
content of the <gi>locus</gi> element, using the conventions
appropriate to the individual scholar or holding institution, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus>ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>A normalized form of the location can also be
supplied, using special purpose attributes on the <gi>locus</gi>
element, as in the following revision of the above example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus from="1r" to="24r">ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>When the <ident type="module">trans</ident> module described in
chapter <ptr target="#PH"/> is included in a schema, an additional
attribute <att>facs</att> is available, which may be used to  associate a
<gi>locus</gi> element with a digitized image, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>Several of the miniatures in this section have been damaged and 
overpainted at a later date (e.g. the figure of Christ on 
<locus facs="http://www.example.com/images.fr#F33R">fol. 33r</locus>; the face of the 
Shepherdess on <locus facs="http://www.example.com/images.fr#F59V">fol. 59v</locus>, 
etc.).</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
Here, the <att>facs</att> attribute uses a URI reference to point directly to images of the
relevant pages, held presumably in an image archive not forming part
of the resource containing the manuscript description in question. In
the case where such images do form part of a single virtual document,
along with transcriptions and metadata, the methods described in <ptr target="#PHFAX"/> should be used in preference.</p>
<p>Where a transcription of the relevant pages is also available, this
may be pointed to using the <att>target</att> attribute, as in the
following example:

	<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<!-- within ms description -->
            <msItem n="1">
              <locus target="#f1r #f1v #f2r">ff. 1r-2r</locus>
              <author>Ben Jonson</author>
              <title>Ode to himself</title>
              <rubric rend="italics">
               An Ode<lb/> to him selfe.</rubric>
              <incipit>Com leaue the loathed stage</incipit>
              <explicit>And see his chariot triumph ore his wayne.</explicit>
              <bibl><name>Beal</name>, <title>Index 1450-1625</title>, JnB 380</bibl>
            </msItem>

	    <!-- within transcription ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f1r"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f1v"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f2r"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	</egXML>
</p>


<p>Where a manuscript contains more than one foliation, the
<att>scheme</att> attribute may be used to distinguish them. For
example, MS 65 Corpus Christi College, Cambridge contains two fly
leaves bearing music. These leaves have modern foliation 135 and
136 respectively, but are also marked with an older foliation. This
may be preserved in an encoding such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<locus scheme="#original">XCIII</locus>
<locus scheme="#modern">135</locus>
</egXML> Here the <att>scheme</att> attribute points to a
<gi>foliation</gi> element providing more details about the scheme
used, as further discussed in <ptr target="#msphfo"/> below.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msnames">
<head>Names of Persons, Places, and Organizations</head>
<p>The standard TEI element <gi>name</gi> may be used to identify
names of any kind occurring within a description:
<specList>
<specDesc key="name" />
</specList>
As further discussed in <ptr target="#CONARS"/>, this element is a member of
the class <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident>, from which it
inherits the  following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.canonical" atts="key ref"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <gi>name</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<name type="person">Thomas Hoccleve</name>
<name type="place">Villingaholt</name>
<name type="org">Vetus Latina Institut</name>
<name type="person" ref="#HOC001">Occleve</name>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note that the <gi>name</gi> element is defined as providing
information about a <emph>name</emph>, not the person, place, or organization to which that name refers. In the last example above, the <att>ref</att> attribute is used to
associate the name with a more detailed description of the person
named. This is provided by means of the <gi>person</gi> element, which
becomes available when the <ident type="module">namesdates</ident>
module described in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> is included in a
schema. An element such as the following might then be used to provide
detailed information about the person indicated by the name:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<person xml:id="HOC001">
<persName><surname>Hoccleve</surname>
<forename>Thomas</forename>
</persName>
<birth notBefore="1368"/>
<occupation>poet</occupation>
<!-- other personal data -->
</person></egXML>

<!--<specList>
<specDesc key="person"/>
</specList>-->
Note that an instance of the 
<gi>person</gi> element must be provided for each distinct
<att>ref</att> value specified. In the example above, the value
<val>HOC001</val> must be found as the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of
some <gi>person</gi>; the same
value will be used as the <att>ref</att> attribute of every reference
to Hoccleve in the document (however spelled), but there will only be
one <gi>person</gi> element with this identifier.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <att>key</att> attribute may be used to supply
an unique identifying code for the person referenced by the name
independently of both the existence of  a <gi>person</gi> element and
the use of the standard URI reference mechanism. If, for example, a
project maintains as its authority file some non-digital resource, or
uses  a database which cannot readily be
integrated with other digital resources for this purpose, the unique
codes used by such <soCalled>offline</soCalled> resources may be used
as values for the <att>key</att> attribute. Although such practices clearly
reduce the interchangeability of the resulting encoded texts, they may
be judged more convenient or practical in certain situations.
</p>

<p>All the <gi>person</gi> elements referenced by a particular
document set should be collected together within a <gi>listPerson</gi>
<!-- need xref -->
element, located in the TEI Header. This functions as a kind
of prosopography for all the people referenced by the set of
manuscripts being described, in much the same way as a
<gi>listBibl</gi> element in the back matter may be used to hold
bibliographic information for all the works referenced.</p>

<p>When the <ident type="module">namesdates</ident> module described
in chapter <ptr target="#ND"/> is included in a schema, similar mechanisms are used to maintain and reference canonical
lists of places or organizations, as further discussed in sections
<ptr target="#NDPLAC"/> and <ptr target="#NDORG"/> respectively. </p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmisc">
<head>Catchwords, Signatures, Secundo Folio</head>
<p>The <gi>catchwords</gi> element is used to describe one method by
which correct ordering of the quires of a codex is ensured. Typically,
this takes the form of a word or phrase written in the lower margin of
the last leaf verso of a gathering, which provides a preview of the
first recto leaf of the successive gathering. This may be a simple
phrase such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catchwords>Quires signed on the last leaf verso in roman numerals.</catchwords>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain more details:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<catchwords>Vertical catchwords in the hand of the scribe placed along 
the inner bounding line, reading from top to bottom.</catchwords>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <soCalled>Signatures</soCalled> element is used, in a similar
way, to describe a similar  system in which quires or leaves are
marked  progressively  in order to facilitate arrangement during
binding. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>At the bottom of the first four leaves of quires 1-14 are 
  the remains of a series of quire signatures a-o plus roman figures in 
  a cursive hand of the fourteenth century.</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>signatures</gi> element can be used for either leaf
signatures, or a combination of quire and leaf signatures, whether the
marking is alphabetic, alphanumeric, or some ad hoc system, as in the
following more complex example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>Quire and leaf signatures in letters, [b]-v, and roman numerals; 
those in quires 10 (1) and 17 (s) in red ink and different from others; 
every third quire also signed with red crayon in arabic numerals in the 
centre lower margin of the first leaf recto: "2" for quire 4 (f. 19), 
"3" for quire 7 (f. 43); "4", barely visible, for quire 10 (f. 65), "5", 
in a later hand, for quire 13 (f. 89), "6", in a later hand, for quire 
16 (f. 113).</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>secFol</gi> element (for <soCalled>secundo
folio</soCalled>) is used to record an identifying phrase (also
called <foreign>dictio probatoria</foreign>)  taken from a
specific known point in a codex (for example the first few words on
the second leaf). Since these words will differ from one copy of
a text to another, the practice originated in the middle ages of using
them when cataloguing a manuscript in order to distinguish individual
copies of a work in a way which its opening words could not.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<div type="div3" xml:id="mshera">
<head>Heraldry</head><!-- rename as armsDesc? -->
<p>Descriptions of heraldic arms, supporters, devices, and mottos may
appear at various points in the description of a manuscript, usually in the context of ownership
information, binding descriptions, or detailed accounts of
illustrations. A full description may also contain a detailed account of the
heraldic components of a manuscript independently considered. Frequently, however, heraldic descriptions will
be cited as short phrases within other parts of the record. The phrase
level element <gi>heraldry</gi> is provided to allow such phrases to
be marked for further  analysis, as in the following
examples:

<head>The Manuscript Identifier</head>
<p>The <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element is intended to provide an
unambiguous means of uniquely identifying a particular
manuscript. This may be done in a structured way, by providing
 information about the holding institution and the call number,
shelfmark, or other identifier used to indicate its location within
that institution. Alternatively, or in addition, a manuscript may be
identified simply by a commonly used name.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
</specList></p>
<p>A manuscript's actual physical location may occasionally be
different from its place of ownership; at Cambridge University, for
example, manuscripts owned by various colleges are kept in the central
University Library. Normally, it is the ownership of the manuscript which should
be specified in the manuscript identifier, while additional or more
precise information on the physical location of the manuscript can be
given within the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>
<p>The following elements are available within <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
to identify the holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="country"/>
<specDesc key="region"/>
<specDesc key="settlement"/>
<specDesc key="institution"/>
<specDesc key="repository"/>
</specList></p>
<p>These elements are all structurally equivalent to the standard TEI
<gi>name</gi> element with an appropriate value for its
<att>type</att> attribute; however the use of this <soCalled>syntactic
sugar</soCalled> enables the model for <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to be
constrained rather more tightly than would otherwise be
possible. Specifically, only one of each of the elements listed above
may appear within the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and they must, if present,
appear in the order given.</p>
<p>Like <gi>name</gi>, these elements are all also members of the  attribute class
<ident type="class">att.canonical</ident>, and thus can use the
attributes <att>key</att> or <att>ref</att> to reference a single
standardized source of information about the entity named. </p>
<p>The following elements are used within <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to
provide different ways of identifying the manuscript within its holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="collection"/>
<specDesc key="idno"/>
<specDesc key="altIdentifier"/>
<specDesc key="msName"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Major manuscript repositories will usually have a preferred
form of citation for manuscript shelfmarks, including rules
about punctuation, spacing, abbreviation, etc., which should be
adhered to. Where such a format also contains information which might
additionally be supplied as a distinct subcomponent of the
<gi>msIdentifier</gi>, for example a collection name,
a decision must be taken as to whether to use the more specific
element, or to include such information within the <gi>idno</gi> element. For
example, the manuscript formally identified as <q>El 26 C 0</q> forms
a part of the Ellesmere (<q>El</q>) collection. Either of the
following encodings is therefore feasible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the former example, the preferred form of the identifier can be
retrieved by prefixing the content of the <gi>idno</gi> element with
that of the  <gi>collection</gi> element, while in the latter it is
given explicitly. The advantage of the former is that it it simplifies
accurate retrieval of all manuscripts from a given collection; the
disadvantage is that encoded abbreviations of this kind may not be as
immediately comprehensible. Care should be taken to avoid redundancy:
for example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> would clearly be inappropriate. Equally clearly, 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>Ellesmere</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> might be considered helpful in some circumstances (if, for
example, some of the items in the Ellsemere collection had shelfmarks
which did not begin <q>El</q>)</p>
<p>In cases where the shelfmark  contains no information about the
collection, it may be necessary to provide this explicitly, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>New Jersey</region>
<settlement>Princeton</settlement>
<repository>Princeton University Library</repository>
<collection>Scheide Library</collection>
<idno>MS 71</idno>
<msName>Blickling Homiliary</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In these examples, <gi>msName</gi> has been used to provide
a common name other than the shelfmark by which a manuscript is
known. Where a manuscript has several such names, more than one of these elements may be used, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>Danmark</country>
<settlement>København</settlement>
<repository>Det Arnamagnæanske Institut</repository>
<idno>AM 45 fol.</idno>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Frisianus</msName>
<msName xml:lang="is">Fríssbók</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Here the globally available <att>xml:lang</att> attribute has been
used to specify the language of the alternative names. <!--This is a
standard TEI facility, which may be found useful in certain
environments (for example, when compiling a single catalogue from a
variety of originally different sources), but which may safely be
ignored in others. --><!-- is this second sentence necessary? --></p>
<p>In very rare cases a repository may have only one manuscript (or
only one of any significance), which will have no shelfmark as such
but will be known by a particular name or names. In such
circumstances, the <gi>idno</gi> element may be omitted, and the
manuscript identified by  the name or names used for it, using
one or more <gi>msName</gi> elements, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Rossano</settlement>
<repository xml:lang="it">Biblioteca arcivescovile</repository>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Rossanensis</msName>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex purpureus</msName> 
<msName xml:lang="en">The Rossano Gospels</msName> 
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where manuscripts have moved from one institution to another, or
even within the same institution, they may have identifiers additional
to the ones currently used, such as former shelfmarks, which are
sometimes retained even after they have been officially superseded. In
such cases it may be useful to supply an alternative identifier, with
a detailed structure similar to that of the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
itself. The following example shows a manuscript which had shelfmark
<code>II-M-5</code> in the collection of the Duque de Osuna, but which
now has the shelfmark <code>MS 10237</code> in the National Library in
Madrid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Madrid</settlement>
<repository>Biblioteca Nacional</repository>
<idno>MS 10237</idno>
<altIdentifier>
<region>Andalucia</region>
<settlement>Osuna</settlement>
<repository>Duque de Osuna</repository>
<idno>II-M-5</idno>
</altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Normally, such information would be dealt with under <gi>history</gi>, except in
cases where a manuscript is likely still to be referred to or known by
its former identifier. For example, an institution may have changed
its call number system but still wish to retain a record of the earlier
number, perhaps because the manuscript concerned is frequently cited in print
under its previous number:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Berkeley</settlement>
<institution>University of California</institution>
<repository>Bancroft Library</repository>
<idno>UCB 16</idno>
<altIdentifier><idno>2MS BS1145 I8</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Where (as in this example) no repository is specified for the
<gi>altIdentifier</gi>, it is assumed to be the same as that of the
parent <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. Where the holding institution has only
one preferred form of citation but wishes to retain the other for
internal administrative purposes, the secondary could be given within
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> with an appropriate value on the
<att>type</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Oxford</settlement>
<repository>Bodleian Library</repository>
<idno>MS. Bodley 406</idno>
<altIdentifier type="SC"><idno>2297</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
It might, however, be preferable to include such information within
the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>

<p>Cases of such changed or alternative identifiers should be clearly
distinguished from cases of <soCalled>scattered</soCalled>
manuscripts, that is to say manuscripts which although physically
disjoint are nevertheless generally treated as single units. One
well-known example is the Old Church Slavonic manuscript known as
<title>Codex Suprasliensis</title>, substantial parts of which are to
be found in three separate repositories, in Ljubljana, Warsaw, and
St. Petersburg. This should be represented using three distinct
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements, using an appropriate value on the
type attribute to indicate that these three identifiers are not
alternate ways of referring to the same physical object, but three
parts of the same entity.

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
  <msName xml:lang="la">Codex Suprasliensis</msName>
    <altIdentifier type="partial">
    <settlement>Ljubljana</settlement>
    <repository>Narodna in univerzitetna knjiznica</repository>
    <idno>MS Kopitar 2</idno>
    <note>Contains ff. 10 to 42 only</note>
  </altIdentifier>
  <altIdentifier type="partial">
    <settlement>Warszawa</settlement>
    <repository>Biblioteka Narodowa</repository>
    <idno>BO 3.201</idno>
  </altIdentifier>
  <altIdentifier type="partial">
    <settlement>Sankt-Peterburg</settlement>
    <repository>Rossiiskaia natsional'naia biblioteka</repository>
    <idno>Q.p.I.72</idno>
  </altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the smallest possible description is one that
contains only the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi>; good practice in all
but exceptional circumstances requires the presence within it of the
three sub-elements <gi>settlement</gi>, <gi>repository</gi>, and
<gi>idno</gi>, since they provide what is, by common consent, the
minimum amount of information necessary to identify a manuscript.</p>

<head>The Manuscript Heading</head>
<p>Historically, the briefest possible meaningful description of a
manuscript consists of no more than a title,
e.g. <mentioned>Polychronicon</mentioned>. This will often have been
enough to identify a manuscript in a small collection because the
identity of the author is implicit. Where a title does not imply the
author, and is thus insufficient to identify the main text of a
manuscript, the author should be stated explicitly
(e.g. <mentioned>Augustinus, Sermones</mentioned> or <mentioned>Cicero,
Letters</mentioned>). Many inventories of manuscripts consist of no
more than an author and title, with some form of copy-specific
identifier, such as a shelfmark or <soCalled>secundo folio</soCalled> reference
(e.g. <mentioned>Arch. B. 3. 2: Evangelium Matthei cum
glossa</mentioned>, <mentioned>126. Isidori Originum libri
octo</mentioned>, <mentioned>Biblia Hieronimi, 2o fo. opus
est</mentioned>); information on date and place of writing will
sometimes also be included. The standard TEI element <gi>head</gi>
element can be used to provide a brief description of this kind.
<specList>
<specDesc key="head"/>
</specList>
In this way the cataloguer or scholar can supply in one place a
minimum of essential information, such as might be displayed or
printed as the heading of a full description. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head>Marsilius de Inghen, Abbreviata phisicorum Aristotelis; Italy, 1463.</head>
</egXML>
Any phrase-level elements, such as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>date</gi>, or the specialized elements <gi>origPlace</gi> and
<gi>origDate</gi>, can also be used within a <gi>head</gi> element,
but it should be remembered that the <gi>head</gi> element is intended
principally to contain a heading. More
structured information concerning the contents, physical form, or
history of the manuscript should be given within the specialized
elements described below, <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>physDesc</gi>,
<gi>history</gi>, etc. However, in simple cases, the <gi>p</gi>
element may also be used to supply an unstructured collection of
such information, as in the example given above (<ptr target="#msdesc"/>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msco">
<head>Intellectual Content</head>
<p>The <gi>msContents</gi> element is used to describe the
intellectual content of a manuscript or manuscript part. It comprises
<emph>either</emph> a series of informal prose paragraphs
<emph>or</emph> a series of <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
elements, each of which provides a more detailed description of a
single item contained within the manuscript. These may be prefaced, if
desired, by a <gi>summary</gi> element, which is especially useful
where one wishes to provide an overview of a manuscript's contents and
describe only some of the items in detail.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="msItem"/>
<specDesc key="msItemStruct"/>
</specList></p>
<p>In the simplest case, only a brief description may be provided, as
in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<p>A collection of Lollard sermons</p>
</msContents>
<msContents>
<p>Atlas of the world from Western Europe and Africa to Indochina,

<p>This description may of course be expanded to include any of the
TEI elements generally available within a <gi>p</gi> element, such as
<gi>title</gi>, <gi>bibl</gi>, or <gi>list</gi>. More usually,
however, each individual work within a manuscript will be given its
own description, using the <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>

<div type="div3" xml:id="mscoit"><head>The <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> Elements</head>
<!-- I'm for killing off msItemStruct, personally -->
<p>Each discrete item in a manuscript or manuscript part can be described within a distinct <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi> element, and may be classified using the <att>class</att> attribute.</p>
<p>These are the possible component elements of <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi>.
<specList>
<specDesc key="author"/>
<specDesc key="respStmt"/>
<specDesc key="title" atts="type"/>

<specDesc key="textLang"/>
</specList></p>
<p>In addition, a <gi>msItemStruct</gi> may contain nested
<gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements, just as an <gi>msItem</gi> may contain
nested <gi>msItem</gi> elements.</p>
<p>The main difference between <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is
that in the former, the order and number of child elements is not
constrained; any element, in other words, may be given in any order,
and repeated as often as is judged necessary. In the latter, however, the
sub-elements, if used, must be given in the order specified above and
only some of  them may be repeated; specifically,  <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>finalRubric</gi>.  <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>textLang</gi> and
<gi>explicit</gi> can appear only once.</p>
<p>While  neither
<gi>msItem</gi> nor <gi>msItemStruct</gi> may contain untagged running
text, both permit an unstructured description to be provided in the
form of  one
or more paragraphs of text. They differ in this respect also: if
paragraphs are supplied as the content of an <gi>msItem</gi>, then
none of the other component elements listed above is permitted; in the
<gi>msItemStruct</gi> case, however, paragraphs may appear anywhere
as an alternative to any of the component elements listed above. 
</p>
<p>As noted above, both
<gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements may
also nest, where a number of separate items in a manuscript are
grouped under a single title or rubric, as is the case, for example,
with a work like <title>The Canterbury Tales</title>.</p>

<p>The elements <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>msItem</gi>,
<gi>msItemStruct</gi>, <gi>incipit</gi>, and <gi>explicit</gi> are all
members of the class <ident type="class">att.msExcerpt</ident> from
which they inherit the <att>defective</att> attribute.
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.msExcerpt" atts="defective"/>
</specList>
This attribute can be used for example with collections
of fragments, where each fragment is given as a separate
<gi>msItem</gi> and the first and last words of each fragment are transcribed as
defective incipits and explicits, as in the following example, a
manuscript containing four fragments of a single work:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>The elements <gi>ex</gi>, <gi>am</gi>, and
<gi>expan</gi> used in the above example are further discussed in
section <ptr target="#PHAB"/>; they are available  only when the <ident type="module">transcr</ident> module defined by that chapter is
selected. Similarly, the <gi>g</gi> element used in this example to
represent the abbreviation mark is defined by the <ident type="module">gaiji</ident> module documented in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>. </p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msat"><head>Authors and Titles</head>
<p>When used within a manuscript description, the <gi>title</gi> element should be used to supply a regularized
form of the item's title, as distinct from any rubric quoted from the
manuscript. If the item concerned has a standardized distinctive
title, e.g. <mentioned>Roman de la Rose</mentioned>, then this should
be the form given as content of the <gi>title</gi> element, with the
value of the <att>type</att> attribute given as
<code>uniform</code>. If no uniform title exists for an item, or none
has been yet identified, or if one wishes to provide a general
designation of the contents, then a <soCalled>supplied</soCalled>
title can be given, e.g. <mentioned>missal</mentioned>, in which case
the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>title</gi> should be given
the value <code>supplied</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, if used within a manuscript description, the <gi>author</gi> element should always
contain the normalized form of an author's name, irrespective of how
(or whether) this form of the name is cited in the manuscript. If it
is desired to retain the form of the author's name as given in the
manuscript, this may be tagged as a distinct <gi>name</gi> element,
within the text at the point where it occurs. </p>
<!-- an example would be nice here -->
<p>Note that the <att>key</att> attribute can also be used, as on
names in general, to specify the identifier of a <gi>person</gi>
element carrying full details of the person concerned (see further
<ptr target="#msnames"/>).</p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can be used to supply the name and role of a person other than the author who is responsible for some aspect of the intellectual content of the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<author>Diogenes Laertius</author>
<respStmt>
<resp>in the translation of</resp>
<name>Ambrogio Traversari</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can also be used where there is a discrepancy between the author of an item as given in the manuscript and the accepted scholarly view, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<title type="supplied">Sermons on the Epistles and the Gospels</title>
<respStmt>
<resp>here erroneously attributed to</resp>
<name>St. Bonaventura</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
Note that such attributions of authorship, both correct and incorrect, are frequently found in the rubric or final rubric (and occasionally also elsewhere in the text), and can therefore be transcribed and included in the description, if desired, using the <gi>rubric</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, or <gi>quote</gi> elements, as appropriate.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mscorie"><head>Rubrics, Incipits, Explicits, and Other Quotations from the Text</head>
<p>It is customary in a manuscript description to record the opening
and closing words of a text as well as any headings or colophons it
might have, and the specialised elements <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, and
<gi>colophon</gi> are available within <gi>msItem</gi> for doing so,
along with the more general <gi>quote</gi>, for recording other bits of
the text not covered by these elements. Each of these elements has the
same substructure, containing a mixture of phrase-level elements and
plain text. A <gi>locus</gi> element can be included within each, in
order to specify the location of the component, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem><locus>f. 1-223</locus>
<author>Radulphus Flaviacensis</author>
<title>Expositio super Leviticum </title>
<incipit><locus>f. 1r</locus>
Forte Hervei monachi</incipit>
<explicit><locus>f. 223v</locus>
Benedictio salis et aquae</explicit>
</msItem>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the following example, standard TEI elements for the
transcription of primary sources have been used to mark the expansion
of abbreviations and other features present in the original:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem defective="true">
<locus>ff. 1r-24v</locus>
<title type="uniform">Ágrip af Noregs konunga sǫgum</title>

h<ex>on</ex>o<ex>m</ex> annan til reiþ<ex>ar</ex></explicit>
</msItem>
</egXML>
Note here also the use of the <att>defective</att> attribute on <gi>incipit</gi> and <gi>explicit</gi> to indicate that the text begins and ends defectively.
</p>
<p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute for <gi>colophon</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>quote</gi>, and <gi>rubric</gi> may always be used to identify the language of the text quoted, if this is different from the default language specified by the <att>mainLang</att> attribute on <gi>textLang</gi>.</p>
</div>
<!-- I thought it might be nice to have something on filiation -->
<div type="div3" xml:id="msfil">
<head>Filiation</head>
<p>The <gi>filiation</gi> element can be used to provide information on the relationship between the manuscript and other surviving manuscripts of the same text, either specifically or in a general way, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem>
  <locus>118rb</locus>
  <incipit>Ecce morior cum nichil horum ... <ref>[Dn 13, 43]</ref>. Verba ista dixit Susanna de illis</incipit>

</msItem>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msclass"><head>Text Classification</head>
<p>One or more text classification or text-type codes may be
specified, either for the whole of the <gi>msContents</gi> element, or
for one or more of its constituent <gi>msItem</gi> elements, using the
<att>class</att> attribute as specified above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem n="1" defective="false" class="#law">
<locus from="1v" to="71v">1v-71v</locus>

<explicit>en<ex>n</ex> u<ex>ir</ex>da 
þo t<ex>il</ex> fullra aura</explicit>
</msItem>
</msContents></egXML>
The value of the <att>class</att> attribute
should specify the identifier used for the appropriate classification
within a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element, defined in the <gi>classDecl</gi>
element of the TEI Header (<ptr target="#HD55"/>), as
shown here:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<classDecl><taxonomy>
<!-- -->
<category xml:id="law">

</category>

</taxonomy></classDecl>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mslangs">
<head>Languages and Writing Systems</head>
<p>The <gi>textLang</gi> element should be used to provide
information about the languages used within a manuscript item. It may take
the form of a simple note, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang>Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic script.</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where, for validation and indexing purposes, it is thought
convenient to add keywords identifying the particular languages used,
the <att>mainLang</att> attribute may be used. This attribute takes
the same range of values as the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute,
on which see further <ptr target="#CHSH"/>. In the following
example a manuscript written chiefly in Old Church Slavonic is described:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu">Old Church Slavonic</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<!-- here I would like to add the these two attributes are also available on msContents -->
<p>A manuscript item will sometimes contain material in more than one language. The 
<att>mainLang</att> attribute should be used only for the chief language. 
Other languages used may be specified using the <att>otherLangs</att>
attribute as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu" otherLangs="RUS HEL">Mostly Old Church 
Slavonic, with some Russian and Greek material</textLang>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Since Old Church Slavonic may be written in either
Cyrillic or Glagolitic scripts, and even occasionally in both within the
same manuscript, it might be preferable to use a more explicit
identifier:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu-Cyrs">Old Church Slavonic in Cyrillic script</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<p>The form and scope of language identifiers recommended by these
Guidelines is based on the IANA standard described at <ptr target="#CHSH"/> and should be followed throughout. Where additional 
detail is needed correctly  to describe a language, or to discuss its
deployment in a given text, this should be done using the
<gi>langUsage</gi> element in the TEI Header, within which
individual <gi>language</gi> elements document the languages
used: see <ptr target="#HD41"/>.  </p>
<p>Note that the <gi>language</gi> element defines a particular
combination of human language and writing system. Only one
<gi>language</gi> element may be supplied for each such
combination. Standard TEI practice also allows this element to be
referenced by any element using the global <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute in order to specify the language applicable to the content
of that element. For example, assuming that <gi>language</gi>
elements have been defined with the identifiers <ident>fr</ident> (for
French), <ident>la</ident> (for Latin), and <ident>de</ident> (for
German), a manuscript description written in French which specifies
that a particular manuscript contains predominantly German but also
some Latin material, might
have a <gi>textLang</gi> element like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang xml:lang="fr" mainLang="de" otherLangs="la">allemand et latin</textLang>
</egXML></p>

<head>Physical Description</head>
<p>Under the general heading <soCalled>physical description</soCalled>
we subsume a large number of different aspects generally regarded as
useful in the description of a given manuscript. These include:
<list>
<item>aspects
of the form, support, extent, and quire structure of the manuscript
object and of the way in which the text is laid out on the page (<ptr target="#msph1"/>);</item>
<item>the styles  of writing, such as the
way it is laid out on the page, the styles of writing,  decorative
features, any musical
notation employed and any annotations or marginalia (<ptr target="#msph2"/>);</item>
<item> and discussion of its binding, seals, and any
accompanying material (<ptr target="#msph3"/>).</item>
</list></p>
<p>Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories
of information though few include them all, and not all distinguish
them as clearly as we propose here. In particular, it is often the
case that an existing description will include information for which
we propose distinct elements within a single paragraph, or even
sentence. The encoder must then decide whether to rewrite the
description using the structure proposed here, or to retain the
existing prose, marked up simply as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements,
directly within the <gi>physDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>The <gi>physDesc</gi> element may thus be used in either of two
distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics
listed above and similar ones. Alternatively, it may act as a container for any
choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of
this section, each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs,
and may also have more specific attributes. <!--Note that the two ways
must <emph>not</emph> be combined within the same
description.--></p>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to combine unstructured prose
description with usage of the more specialised elements, as such an
approach complicates processing, and may lead to inconsistency within
a single manuscript description. A single <gi>physDesc</gi> element
will normally contain either a series of <ident
type="class">model.pLike</ident> elements, or a sequence of
specialised elements from the <ident type="class">model.physDescPart</ident>
class. There are however circumstances in which this is not feasible,
for example:
<list>
<item>the description already exists in a prose form where some of the
specialised topics are treated together in paragraphs of prose, but
others are treated distinctly;</item>
<item>although all  parts of the description are clearly
distinguished, some of them cannot be mapped to a pre-existing
specialised element.</item>
</list></p>
<p>In such situations, both specialised and generic
(<ident>model.Plike</ident>) elements may be combined in a single
<gi>physDesc</gi>. Note however that all generic elements given must
precede the first specialised element in the description. Thus the
following is valid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<physDesc>
<p>Generic descriptive prose...</p>
<!-- other generic elements here -->
<objectDesc form="codex"> 
<!-- ... -->
</objectDesc>
<!-- other specific elements here -->
</physDesc></egXML>
but neither of the following is valid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
<physDesc>
<objectDesc form="codex"> 
<!-- ... -->
</objectDesc>
<p>Generic descriptive prose...</p>
</physDesc>]]></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
<physDesc>
<objectDesc form="codex"> 
  <!-- ... -->
</objectDesc>
<p>Generic descriptive prose...</p>
<!-- other specific elements here -->
</physDesc>]]></egXML>
The order in which specific elements may appear is also constrained by
the content model; again this is for simplicity of processing. They
may of course be processed or displayed in any desired order, but for
ease of validation, they must be given in the order specified
below.</p>


<div type="div3" xml:id="msph1"><head>Object Description</head>
<p>The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is used to group together those
parts of the physical description which relate specifically to the
text-bearing object, its format, constitution, layout, etc. The
<att>form</att> attribute is used to indicate the specific type of
writing vehicle being described, for example, as a codex, roll,
tablet, etc. If used it must appear first in the sequence of
specialised elements. The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element has two parts: a description of the
<term>support</term>, i.e. the physical carrier on which the text is
inscribed; and a description of the <term>layout</term>, i.e. the way
text is organized on the carrier.</p>
<p>Taking these in turn, the description of the support is tagged
using the following elements, each of which is discussed in more
detail below:
<specList>
<specDesc key="supportDesc"/>
<specDesc key="support"/>
<specDesc key="extent"/>
<specDesc key="collation"/>
<specDesc key="foliation"/>
<specDesc key="condition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Each of these elements contains paragraphs relating to the topic
concerned. Within these paragraphs, phrase-level elements (in
particular those discussed above at <ptr target="#msphrase"/>),
may be used to tag specific terms of interest if so
desired.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<objectDesc form="codex">
<supportDesc>
<p>Mostly <material>paper</material>, with watermarks 
<watermark>unicorn</watermark> (<ref>Briquet 9993</ref>) and 
<watermark>ox</watermark> (close to <ref>Briquet 2785</ref>). 
The first and last leaf of each quire, with the exception of 
quires xvi and xviii, are constituted by bifolia of parchment, 
and all seven miniatures have been painted on inserted 
singletons of parchment.</p>
</supportDesc>
</objectDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>This example combines information which might alternatively be more
precisely tagged using the more specific elements described in the
following subsections.</p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1sup">
<head>Support</head>
<p>The <gi>support</gi> element groups together information about the
physical carrier. Typically, for western manuscripts, this will entail
discussion of the material (parchment, paper, or a combination of the
two) written on. For paper, a discussion of any watermarks present may
also be useful.  If this discussion makes reference to standard
catalogues of such items, these may be tagged using the standard
<gi>ref</gi> element as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<support><p>
<material>Paper</material> with watermark: <watermark>anchor in a circle 
with star on top</watermark>, <watermark>countermark B-B with 
trefoil</watermark> similar to <ref>Moschin, Anchor N 1680</ref>
<date>1570-1585</date>.</p></support>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1ext">
<head>Extent</head>
<p>The <gi>extent</gi> element, defined in the TEI header, may also be
used in a manuscript description to specify the number of
leaves a manuscript contains, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 97 + ii</extent>
</egXML>
Information regarding the size of the leaves may be
specifically marked using the phrase level <gi>dimensions</gi>
element, as in the following example, or left as plain prose.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 321 leaves 
<dimensions unit="cm">
<height>35</height>
<width>27</width>
</dimensions>
</extent>
</egXML></p>
<p>Alternatively, the generic <gi>measure</gi> element might be used within <gi>extent</gi>, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>
  <measure type="composition" unit="leaf" quantity="10">10 Bl.</measure>
  <measure type="height" quantity="37" unit="cm">37</measure> x
  <measure type="width" quantity="29" unit="cm">29</measure> cm
</extent>
</egXML></p>

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1col">
<head>Collation</head>
<p>The <gi>collation</gi> element should be used to provide a
description of a book's current and original structure, that is, the
arrangement of its leaves and quires. This information may be conveyed
using informal prose, or any appropriate notational
convention. Although no specific notation is defined here, an
appropriate element to enclose such an expression would be the <gi>formula</gi>
element, which is provided when the <ident type="module">figures</ident> module is included in a schema. Here are some examples of different ways of treating collation:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collation><p><formula>1-3:8, 4:6, 5-13:8</formula></p></collation>
<collation>
<p>There are now four gatherings, the first, second and fourth originally consisting of 
eight leaves, the third of seven. A fifth gathering thought to have followed has left no trace.

<item>Gathering I consists of 7 leaves, a first leaf, originally conjoint with <locus>fol. 7</locus>, 
having been cut away leaving only a narrow strip along the gutter; the others, <locus>fols 1</locus>

</p>
</collation>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphfo">
<head>Foliation</head>
<p>The <gi>foliation</gi> element may be used to indicate the scheme,
medium or location of folio, page, column, or line numbers written in
the manuscript, frequently including a statement about when and, if
known, by whom, the numbering was done.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<foliation><p>Neuere Foliierung, die auch das Vorsatzblatt mitgezählt hat.</p></foliation>

</egXML>
</p>
<p>Where a manuscript contains traces of more than
one foliation, each should be recorded as a distinct
<gi>foliation</gi> element and optionally given a distinct value for
its <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>locus</gi> element discussed in
<ptr target="#msloc"/> can then indicate which foliation scheme is being cited
by means of its <att>scheme</att> attribute, which points to this
identifier:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<foliation xml:id="original"><p>Original foliation in red roman numerals in the middle of

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphco">
<head>Condition</head>
<p>The <gi>condition</gi> element is used to summarize the overall
physical state of a manuscript, in particular where such information
is not recorded elsewhere in the description. It should not, however, be
used to describe changes or repairs to a manuscript, as these are more
appropriately described as a part of its custodial history (see <ptr
target="#msadch"/>). It should be supplied within the
<gi>supportDesc</gi> element, if it  discusses the condition of the
physical support of the manuscript; within the <gi>bindingDesc</gi> or <gi>binding</gi> elements (<ptr
target="#msphbi"/>) if it discusses only the condition of the binding or
bindings concerned; or within the <gi>sealDesc</gi> element if it
discusses the condition of any seal attached to the manuscript.</p>

</egXML>
<!-- need another condition example -->

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphla"><head>Layout Description</head>
<p>The second part of the <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is the
<gi>layoutDesc</gi> element, which is used to describe and document the
<foreign>mise-en-page</foreign> of the manuscript, that is the way in which text and illumination are arranged on the page, specifying for example the number of written, ruled, or
pricked lines and columns per page, size of margins,
distinct blocks such as glosses, commentaries, etc. This may be given as a simple
series of paragraphs. Alternatively, one or more different layouts
may be identified within a single manuscript, each described by its
own <gi>layout</gi> element. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="layoutDesc"/>
<specDesc key="layout"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Where the <gi>layout</gi> element is used, the layout will often be
sufficiently regular for the attributes on this element to convey all
that is necessary; more usually however a more detailed treatment will
be required. The attributes are provided as a convenient shorthand for
commonly occurring cases, and should not be used except where the
layout is regular. The value <code>NA</code> (not-applicable) should
be used for cases where the layout is either very irregular, or where
it cannot be characterized simply in terms of lines and columns, for
example, where blocks of commentary and text are arranged in a regular
but complex pattern on each page</p>
<p>The following examples indicate the range of possibilities:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<layout ruledLines="25 32">
<p>Most pages have between 25 and 32 long lines ruled in lead.</p>
</layout>
<layout columns="1" writtenLines="24">
<p>Written in one column throughout; 24 lines per page.</p>
</layout>
<layout><p>Written in 3 columns, with 8 lines of text and interlinear glosses in 
the centre, and up to 26 lines of gloss in the outer two columns. Double 
vertical bounding lines ruled in hard point on hair side. Text lines ruled 
faintly in lead. Remains of prickings in upper, lower, and outer (for 8 lines 
of text only) margins.</p></layout>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where multiple <gi>layout</gi> elements are supplied, the scope for
each specification can be indicated by means of <gi>locus</gi>
elements within the content of the element, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<layoutDesc>

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphwr">
<head>Writing</head>
<p>The <gi>handDesc</gi> element can contain a short description of
the general characteristics of the writing observed in a manuscript,
as in the following example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc>
<p>Written in a <term>late Caroline minuscule</term>; versals in a 
form of <term>rustic capitals</term>; although the marginal and 
interlinear gloss is written in varying shades of ink that are 
not those of the main text, text and gloss appear to have been 
copied during approximately the same time span.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note the use of the <gi>term</gi> element to mark specific technical
terms within the context of the <gi>handDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>Where several distinct hands have been identified, this fact can be registered by using the <att>hands</att> attribute, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="2">
<p>The manuscript is written in two contemporary hands, otherwise
unknown, but clearly those of practised scribes. Hand I writes
ff. 1r-22v and hand II ff. 23 and 24. Some scholars, notably
Verner Dahlerup and Hreinn Benediktsson, have argued for a third hand
on f. 24, but the evidence for this is insubstantial.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Alternatively, or in addition, where more specific
information about one or more of the hands identified is to be recorded,
the <gi>handNote</gi> element should
be used, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="3">
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-1" scope="minor">
<p>The first part of the manuscript, 
<locus from="1v" to="72v:4">fols 1v-72v:4</locus>, is written in a practised 
Icelandic Gothic bookhand. This hand is not found elsewhere.</p></handNote>
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-2" scope="major">
<p>The second part of the manuscript, <locus from="72v:4" to="194v">fols 
72v:4-194</locus>, is written in a hand contemporary with the first; it can 
also be found in a fragment of <title>Knýtlinga saga</title>, 
<ref>AM 20b II fol.</ref>.</p></handNote>
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-3" scope="minor">
<p>The third hand has written the majority of the chapter headings. 
This hand has been identified as the one also found in <ref>AM 
221 fol.</ref>.</p></handNote>
</handDesc>
</egXML>
Note here the use of the <gi>locus</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msloc"/>, to specify exactly which parts of a
manuscript are written by a given hand.</p>
<p>When a full or partial transcription of a manuscript is available
in addition to the manuscript description, the <gi>handShift</gi>
element described in <ptr target="#PHDH"/> can be used to link the
relevant parts of the transcription to the appropriate
<gi>handNote</gi> element in the description: for example, at the
point in the transcript where the second hand listed above starts
(i.e. at folio 72v:4), we might insert <gi>handShift
new="#Eirsp-2"/</gi>.</p>


<p>The elements <gi>typeDesc</gi>,  and <gi>typeNote</gi>
are used
to provide information about the printing of a source, in exactly the same way as the <gi>handDesc</gi> or <gi>handNote</gi>
elements provide information about its writing. They are provided for
the convenience of those using this module to provide information
about early printed sources and incunables. The <gi>typeDesc</gi>
element can simply provide a summary description:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<typeDesc><p>Uses a mixture of Roman and Black Letter types.</p></typeDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Where detailed information about individual typefaces is to be
recorded, this may be done using the <gi>typeNote</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<typeDesc><summary>Uses a mixture of Roman and Black Letter types.</summary>
<typeNote>Antiqua typeface, showing influence of Jenson's Venetian
fonts.</typeNote>
<typeNote>The black letter face is a variant of Schwabacher.</typeNote>
</typeDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Where information is required about both typography and written
script, for example where a printed book contains extensive
handwritten annotation, both <gi>handDesc</gi> and <gi>typeDesc</gi>
elements should be supplied. Similarly, in the following example, the
source text is a typescript with extensive handwritten annotation:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
      <typeDesc>
        <typeNote xml:id="TSET">Authorial

      </handDesc>
    </egXML>
</p>
</div>


<div type="div4" xml:id="msphdec">
<head>Decoration</head>
<p>It can be difficult to draw a clear distinction between aspects of
a manuscript which are purely physical and those which form part of
its intellectual content. This is particularly true of illuminations
and other forms of decoration in a manuscript. We propose the
following elements for the purpose of delimiting discussion of these
aspects within a manuscript description, and for convenience locate
them all within the physical description, despite the fact that the
illustrative features of a manuscript will in many cases also be seen
as constitutiing part of its intellectual content.</p>
<p>The <gi>decoDesc</gi> element may contain simply one or more
paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the decorative features
of the manuscript, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>The decoration comprises two full page miniatures, perhaps added 
by the original owner, or slightly later; the original major decoration
consists of twenty-three large miniatures, illustrating the divisions of 
the Passion narrative and the start of the major texts, and the major 
divisions of the Hours; seventeen smaller miniatures, illustrating the 
suffrages to saints; and seven historiated initials, illustrating
the pericopes and major prayers.</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain a series of more specific typed
<gi>decoNote</gi> elements, each summarizing a particular aspect or
individual instance of the decoration present, for example the use of
miniatures, initials (historiated or otherwise), borders, diagrams,
etc., as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<decoNote type="miniature">
<p>One full-page miniature, facing the beginning of the first 
Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote> 
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>One seven-line historiated initial, commencing the first 
Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>Six four-line decorated initials, commencing the second through the 
seventh Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>Some three hundred two-line versal initials with pen-flourishes, 
commencing the psalm verses.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="border">
<p>Four-sided border decoration surrounding the miniatures and three-sided 
border decoration accompanying the historiated and decorated initials.</p>
</decoNote>
</decoDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where more exact indexing of the decorative content of a manuscript
is required, the standard TEI elements <gi>term</gi> or <gi>index</gi>
may be used within the prose description to supply or delimit
appropriate iconographic terms, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<decoNote type="miniatures">
<p>Fourteen large miniatures with arched tops, above five lines of text:
<list>
<item><locus>fol. 14r</locus>Pericopes. <term>St. John writing on

<!-- ... -->

</decoNote>
</decoDesc>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphmu"><head>Musical Notation</head>
<p>Where a manuscript contains music, the <gi>musicNotation</gi>
element may be used to describe the form of notation employed, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<musicNotation>
<p>Square notation on 4-line red staves.</p>
</musicNotation>
<musicNotation>
<p>Neumes in campo aperto of the St. Gall type.</p>
</musicNotation>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="mspham"><head>Additions and Marginalia</head>
<p>The <gi>additions</gi> element can be used to list or describe any
additions to the manuscript, such as marginalia, scribblings, doodles,
etc., which are considered to be of interest or importance. Such
topics may also be discussed or referenced elsewhere in a description,
for example in the <gi>history</gi> element, in cases where the
marginalia provide evidence of ownership. Some examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<additions><p>Doodles on most leaves, possibly by children, and often quite amusing.</p></additions>
<additions><p xml:lang="fr">Quelques annotations marginales des XVIe et XVIIe s.</p></additions>
<additions>
<p>The text of this manuscript is not interpolated with sentences from 
Royal decrees promulgated in 1294, 1305 and 1314. In the margins, however, 
another somewhat later scribe has added the relevant paragraphs of these 
decrees, see pp. 8, 24, 44, 47 etc.</p>
<p>As a humorous gesture the scribe in one opening of the manuscript, pp. 36 
and 37, has prolonged the lower stems of one letter f and five letters þ 
and has them drizzle down the margin.</p>
</additions>
<additions>
<p>Spaces for initials and chapter headings were left by the scribe but not filled in. 
A later, probably fifteenth-century, hand has added initials and chapter headings in 
greenish-coloured ink on fols <locus>8r</locus>, <locus>8v</locus>, <locus>9r</locus>, 
<locus>10r</locus> and <locus>11r</locus>. Although a few of these chapter headings are 
now rather difficult to read, most can be made out, e.g. fol. <locus>8rb</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">floti ast<ex>ri</ex>d<ex>ar</ex></quote>; fol. <locus>9rb</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">v<ex>m</ex> olaf conung</quote>, and fol. <locus>10ra</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">Gipti<ex>n</ex>g ol<ex>a</ex>fs k<ex>onun</ex>gs</quote>.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains the following marginalia:
<list>
<item>Fol. <locus>4v</locus>, left margin: <quote xml:lang="is">hialmadr <ex>ok</ex> <lb/>brynjadr</quote>, 
in a fifteenth-cenury hand, imitating an addition made to the text by the scribe at this point.</item>
<item>Fol. <locus>5r</locus>, lower margin: <quote xml:lang="is">þ<ex>e</ex>tta þiki 
m<ex>er</ex> v<ex>er</ex>a gott blek en<ex>n</ex>da kan<ex>n</ex> ek icki 
betr sia</quote>, in a fifteenth-century hand, probably the same as that on the previous page.</item>
<item>Fol. <locus>9v</locus>, bottom margin: <quote xml:lang="is">þessa bok uilda eg <sic>gæt</sic> 
lært med <lb/>an Gud gefe myer Gott ad <lb/>læra</quote>; seventeenth-century hand.</item>
</list></p>
<p>There are in addition a number of illegible scribbles in a later hand (or hands) on fols 
<locus>2r</locus>, <locus>3r</locus>, <locus>5v</locus> and <locus>19r</locus>.</p>
</additions>
</egXML></p>

<div type="div3" xml:id="msph3"><head>Bindings, Seals, and Additional Material</head>
<p>The third major component of the physical description relates to
supporting but distinct physical components, such as bindings, 
seals and accompanying material. These may be described using the following specialist elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="bindingDesc"/>
<specDesc key="binding"/>
<specDesc key="sealDesc"/>
<specDesc key="seal"/>
<specDesc key="accMat"/>
</specList></p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphbi"><head>Binding Descriptions</head>
<p>The <gi>bindingDesc</gi> element contains a description of the state of
the present and former bindings of a manuscript, including information
about its material, any distinctive marks, and provenance information. This may
be given as a series of paragraphs if only one binding is being described, or
as a series of distinct <gi>binding</gi> elements, each describing a distinct
binding where these are separately described. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<bindingDesc>
<p>Sewing not visible; tightly rebound over 19th-century pasteboards, reusing 
panels of 16th-century brown leather with gilt tooling à la fanfare, Paris 
c. 1580-90, the centre of each cover inlaid with a 17th-century oval medallion 
of red morocco tooled in gilt (perhaps replacing the identifying mark of a 
previous owner); the spine similarly tooled, without raised bands or title-piece; 
coloured endbands; the edges of the leaves and boards gilt. Boxed.</p>
</bindingDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Within a binding description, the elements <gi>decoNote</gi> and
<gi>condition</gi> are
available, as alternatives to <gi>p</gi>, for paragraphs dealing
exclusively with information about decorative features of a binding,
or about its condition, respectively.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding><p>Bound, s. XVIII (?), in <material>diced russia leather</material>
retaining most of the original 15th century metal ornaments (but with 
some replacements) as well as the heavy wooden boards.</p>
<decoNote><p>On each cover: alternating circular stamps of the Holy Monogram, 
a sunburst, and a flower.</p></decoNote> 
<decoNote><p>On the cornerpieces, one of which is missing, a rectangular stamp 
of the Agnus Dei.</p></decoNote> 
<condition>Front and back leather inlaid panels very badly worn.</condition>
<p>Rebacked during the 19th century.</p>
</binding>
</egXML></p>
<p>As noted above, (<ptr target="#msphco"/>) the element <gi>condition</gi>
,may also be used as an alternative to <gi>p</gi> for paragraphs
concerned exclusively with the condition of a binding, where this has
not been supplied as part of the physical description.</p>


</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphse">
<head>Seals</head>
<p>The <gi>sealDesc</gi> element supplies information about the
seal(s) attached to documents to guarantee their integrity, or to show
authentication of the issuer or consent of the participants. It may
contain one or more paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the
seals, or may contain one or more <gi>seal</gi> elements.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<sealDesc>
<seal n="1" type="pendant" subtype="cauda_duplex">
<p>Round seal of <name>Anders Olufsen</name> in black wax:

</seal>
</sealDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msadac"><head>Accompanying Material</head>
<p>The circumstance may arise where material not originally part of a
manuscript is bound into or otherwise kept with a manuscript. In some
cases this material would best be treated in a separate
<gi>msPart</gi> element (see <ptr target="#mspt"/> below).  There are,
however, cases where the additional matter is not self-evidently a
distinct manuscript: it might, for example, be a set of notes by a
later scholar, or a file of correspondence relating to the
manuscript. The <gi>accMat</gi> element is provided as a holder for
this kind of information.
<specList>
<specDesc key="accMat"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of this element, describing a note by
the Icelandic manuscript collector Árni Magnússon which
has been bound with the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<accMat>
<p>A slip in Árni Magnússon's hand has been stuck to the
pastedown on the inside front cover; the text reads:

<head>History</head>
<p>The following elements are used to record information about the history of a manuscript:
<specList>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="origin"/>
<specDesc key="provenance"/>
<specDesc key="acquisition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The three components of the <gi>history</gi> element all have the
same substructure, consisting of one or more paragraphs marked as
<gi>p</gi> elements. Each of these three elements is also a member of
the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> attribute class, itself a
member of the <ident type="class">att.datable.w3c</ident> class, and
thus also carries the following optional attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.datable.w3c" atts="notBefore notAfter">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>Information about the origins of the manuscript, its place and date
of writing, should be given as one or more paragraphs contained by a
single <gi>origin</gi> element; following this, any available
information on distinct stages in the history of the manuscript before
its acquisition by its current holding institution should be included
as paragraphs within one or more <gi>provenance</gi>
elements. Finally, any information specific to the means by which the
manuscript was acquired by its present owners should be given as
paragraphs within the <gi>acquisition</gi> element.</p>
<p>Here is a fairly simple example of the use of this element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<head>Administrative information</head>
<p>The <gi>adminInfo</gi> element is used to hold information relating to the curation and management of

<gi>change</gi> elements. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="source"/>
<specDesc key="change"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>source</gi> element is used to document the primary source
of information for the record containing it, in a similar
way to the standard TEI <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element within a TEI
Header. If the record is a new one, made without reference to anything
other than the manuscript itself, then it may simply contain a <gi>p</gi>
element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<source><p>Directly catalogued from the original manuscript.</p></source>

<p>Frequently, however, the record will be derived from some
previously existing description, which may be specified using the
standard TEI <gi>bibl</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<recordHist>
<source><p>Information transcribed from <bibl><title>The index of Middle English verse</title><biblScope>123</biblScope></bibl>.</p></source>

<p>If, as is likely, a full bibliographic description of the source
from which cataloguing information was taken is included within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element contained by the current <gi>additional</gi>

<p>The <gi>change</gi> element 
may also appear within the <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element of the
standard TEI Header; its use here is intended to signal the
similarity of function between the two container elements. Where the
TEI Header should be used to document the revision history of the
whole electronic file to which it is prefixed, the <gi>recordHist</gi>
element may be used to document changes at a lower level, relating to
the individual description, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<change when="2005-03-10">On 10 March 2005
<name>MJD</name> added provenance information</change>
</egXML></p>
</div><div type="div4" xml:id="msadch"><head>Availability and Custodial History</head>
<p>The <gi>availability</gi> element is another element also available
in  the TEI Header,
which should be used here to supply any information concerning
access to the current manuscript, such as its physical location (where this
is not implicit in its identifier), any restrictions on access, information
about copyright, etc.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<availability>
<p>Viewed by appointment only, to be arranged with curator.</p>

<availability>
<p>In conservation, Jan. - Mar., 2002. On loan to the 
Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, April - July, 2002.</p>
</availability>
<availability>
<p>The manuscript is in poor condition, due to many of the leaves being 
brittle and fragile and the poor quality of a number of earlier repairs; 
it should therefore not be used or lent out until it has been conserved.</p>

<p>The <gi>custodialHist</gi> record is used to describe the custodial
history of a manuscript, recording any significant events noted during
the period that it has been located within its holding institution. It
may contain either a series of 
<gi>p</gi> elements, or a series of <gi>custEvent</gi> elements, each
describing a distinct incident or event, further specified by a
<att>type</att> attribute, and carrying dating information by virtue
of its membership in the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, as noted above.
<specList>
<specDesc key="custEvent"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of this element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<custodialHist>
<custEvent type="conservation" notBefore="1961-03-01" notAfter="1963-02-28">

<head>Surrogates</head>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element is used
to provide information about any digital or photographic
representations of the manuscript which may exist within the holding
institution or elsewhere. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="surrogates"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element should not be used to repeat
information about representations of the manuscript available within
published works; this should normally be documented within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element within the <gi>additional</gi>
element. However, it is often also convenient to record information
such as negative numbers or digital identifiers for unpublished
collections of manuscript images maintained within the holding
institution, as well as to provide more detailed descriptive
information about the surrogate itself. Such information may be provided
as prose paragraphs, within which identifying information about particular
surrogates may be presented using the standard TEI <gi>bibl</gi> element,
as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<surrogates>
<p>
<bibl><title type="gmd">microfilm (master)</title><idno>G.neg. 160</idno> n.d.</bibl>

<bibl><title type="gmd">b/w prints</title><idno>reg.nr. 75</idno>
<date when="1999-01-25">25 January 1999</date>
<note>photographs of the spine, outside covers, stitching etc.</note>
</bibl>
</p>
</surrogates>
</egXML>
Note the use of the specialized form of title (<term>general material designation</term>) to specify the kind of surrogate being documented.</p>
<p>At a later revision, the content of the <gi>surrogates</gi> element
is likely to be expanded to include elements more specifically
intended to provide detailed information such as technical details of
the process by which a digital or photographic image was made. For
information about the inclusion of digital facsimile images within a
TEI document, refer also to <ptr target="#PHFAX"/>. </p>

<head>Manuscript Parts</head>
<p>The <gi>msPart</gi> element may be used in cases where what were
originally physically separate manuscripts or parts of manuscripts
have been bound together and/or share the same call number.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Since each component of such a composite manuscript will in all
likelihood have its own content, physical description, history, and so
on, the structure of <gi>msPart</gi> is in the main identical to that
of <gi>msDesc</gi>, allowing one to retain the top level of
identity (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>), but to branch out thereafter into as
many parts, or even subparts, as necessary. If the parts of a
composite manuscript have their own identifiers, they should be tagged
using the <gi>idno</gi> element, rather than the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
element, as in the following example:
<!-- don't understand why these need to to wrapped in <altIdentifier> -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msDesc>
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Amiens</settlement>
<repository>Bibliothèque Municipale</repository>
<idno>MS 3</idno>
<msName>Maurdramnus Bible</msName>
