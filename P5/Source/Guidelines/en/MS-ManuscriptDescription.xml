<head>Manuscript Description</head>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msov">
<head>Overview</head>
<p>This module defines a special purpose element which can be used to
provide detailed descriptive information about handwritten primary sources. 
Although originally developed to meet the needs of cataloguers and
scholars working with medieval manuscripts in the European tradition, the scheme 
presented here is general enough that it can also be extended to other traditions 
and materials, and is potentially useful for any kind of inscribed artefact.</p>
<p>The scheme described here is also intended to accommodate the needs of
many different classes of encoders. On the one hand, encoders may be
engaged in <term>retrospective conversion</term> of existing detailed
descriptions and catalogues into machine tractable form; on the other,
they may be engaged in cataloguing <foreign>ex nihilo</foreign>, that
is, creating new detailed descriptions for materials never before
catalogued. Some may be primarily concerned to
represent accurately the description itself, as opposed to the ideas
and interpretations the description represents; others may have
entirely opposite priorities. At one
extreme, a project may simply wish to capture an existing catalogue in
a form that can be displayed on the web, and which can be searched for
literal strings, or for such features such as titles, authors and
dates; at the other, a project may wish to create in highly structured
and encoded form a detailed database of information about the physical
characteristics, history, interpretation, etc. of the material, able
to support practitioners of <term>quantitative codicology</term> as
well as librarians.</p>
<p>To cater for this diversity, here as elsewhere, these Guidelines
propose a flexible approach, in which encoders must choose for
themselves the degree of prescription appropriate to their needs, and
are provided with a choice of encoding mechanisms to support those
differing degrees.</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msdesc">
<head>The manuscript description element</head>
<p>The <gi>msDescription</gi> element will normally appear within the
<gi>sourceDesc</gi> element of the header of a TEI conformant
document, where the document being encoded is a digital representation
of some manuscript original, whether as a transcription, as a
collection of digital images, or as some combination of the
two. However, in cases where the document being encoded is essentially a
collection of manuscript descriptions, the <gi>msDescription</gi>
element may be used in the same way as the bibliographic elements (<gi>bibl</gi> <gi>biblStruct</gi>, and <gi>biblItem</gi>) making up the TEI element
class <ident type="class">model.biblLike</ident>. These typically appear within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msDescription"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>msDescription</gi> element has the following components,
which provide more detailed information under a number of
headings. Each of these component elements is further described in the
remainder of this chapter. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
<specDesc key="head"/>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="physDesc"/>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="additional"/>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The first of these components, <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, is the only
one which is mandatory; it is described in more detail in <ptr target="#msid"/> below. It is followed optionally by one or more
<gi>head</gi> elements, each holding a brief heading (see <ptr target="#msdo"/>), and then either one or more paragraphs, marked up
as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements, or one or more of the specialized
elements <gi>msContents</gi> (<ptr target="#msco"/>),
<gi>physDesc</gi> (<ptr target="#msph"/>), <gi>history</gi> (<ptr target="#mshy"/>), and <gi>additional</gi> (<ptr target="#msad"/>).
These elements are all optional, but if used they must appear in the
order given here.  Finally, in the case of a composite manuscript, a
full description may also contain one or more <gi>msPart</gi> elements
(<ptr target="#mspt"/>).</p>
<p>Here is a very simple example of a complete manuscript description, using no additional elements apart from the mandatory <gi>msIdentifier</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>Here is the same description, using some of the manuscript-specific phrase-level elements described below, but still fairly simple:

<p>And finally, a more structured description of the same manuscript,
using many, but by no means all, of the elements described in the
following sections. Note that some slight reordering of the material
has been necessary.

</msDescription>
</egXML></p>
<p>The formal definition for the <gi>msDescription</gi> element is as
follows:
<specGrp xml:id="msdesc.def">
&msDescription;
</specGrp>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msphrase">
<head>Phrase-level elements</head>
<p>When the msdescription module is in use, several extra elements are added to
the phrase level class, and thus become available within paragraphs
and elsewhere in the document. These elements are listed below in
alphabetical order:
<specList>
<specDesc key="catchwords"/>
<specDesc key="dimensions"/>
<specDesc key="heraldry"/>
<specDesc key="locus"/>
<specDesc key="material"/>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
<specDesc key="secFol"/>
<specDesc key="signatures"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Within a manuscript description, many other
standard TEI phrase level elements are available, notably those
described in the Core module (<ptr target="#CO"/>). Additional elements
of particular relevance to manuscript description, such as those for
names and dates, may also be made available by including the relevant
module in one's schema.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msdates">
<head>Origination</head>
<p>The following elements may be used to provide information about the
origins of any aspect of a manuscript:
<specList><specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> elements are
specialized forms of the existing <gi>date</gi> and <gi>name</gi>
elements respectively, used to indicate specifically the date and
place of origin of a manuscript or manuscript part. Such information
would normally be encoded within the <gi>history</gi> element,
discussed in section <ptr target="#mshy"/>. <gi>origDate</gi> and
<gi>origPlace</gi> can also be used to identify the place or date of
origin of any aspect of the manuscript, such as its decoration or
binding, when these are not of the same date as the manuscript
itself. Both these elements are members of the
<ident type="class">att.editLike</ident> class, from which they inherit the
following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.editLike"/></specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> element is a member of the
<ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, and may thus also carry the following
attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.datable"/></specList></p>

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmat">
<head>Material</head>
<p>The <gi>material</gi> element can be used to tag any specific term
used for the material of which a manuscript (or binding, seal, etc.)
is composed.
<specList>
<specDesc key="material"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The element may appear wherever a term regarded as significant by
the encoder occurs, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding>
<p>Brown <material>calfskin</material>, previously with two clasps.</p>
</binding>
</egXML>

</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mswat">
<head>Watermarks and stamps</head>
<p>Two further elements are provided to
mark up other decorative features characteristic of manuscript leaves and
bindings:
<specList>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="stamp"/>
</specList></p>
<p>These element may appear
wherever a term regarded as significant by the encoder occurs. The
<gi>watermark</gi> element is most likely to be of use within the
<gi>support</gi> element, as in the following example: <egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><support><material>Rag
paper</material> with <watermark>anchor</watermark>
watermark</support></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>stamp</gi> element will typically appear when text from the source
is being transcribed, for example within a rubric in the following case:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rubric>Apologyticu TTVLLIANI AC IGNORATIA IN XPO IHV<lb/>
SI NON LICET<lb/>
NOBIS RO<lb/>
manii imperii <stamp>Bodleian stamp</stamp><lb/></rubric></egXML>
</p>
<p>It may also appear as part of the detailed description of a binding :
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding><p>Modern calf recasing with original armorial stamp <stamp>Ex
Bibliotheca J. Richard D.M.</stamp></p></binding>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msdim">
<head>Dimensions</head>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element can be used to specify the size of some aspect of the manuscript, and is thus a specialized form of the existing TEI <gi>measure</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="dimensions" atts="type"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element will normally occur within the
element describing the particular feature or aspect of a manuscript
whose dimensions are being given; thus the size of the leaves would be
specified within the <gi>support</gi> or <gi>extent</gi> element (part
of the <gi>physDesc</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1"/>),
while the dimensions of other specific parts of a manuscript, such as
accompanying materials, binding, etc., would be given in other parts
of the description, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The following three elements are available within the <gi>dimensions</gi> element:
<specList>
<specDesc key="height"/>
<specDesc key="width"/>
<specDesc key="depth"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>These elements are all members of the <ident type="class">att.measured</ident>
 class, and thus all carry the following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.measured" atts="unit scope">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>These elements must be given in the order specified, but groups of
them may be repeated as often as necessary, with appropriate values for their attributes to
indicate the nature and scope of the measurement concerned. For
example, in the following case the leaf size and ruled space of
the leaves of the manuscript are specified:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<dimensions type="leaves" unit="mm">
 <height scope="range">157-160</height>
 <width>105</width>
</dimensions>
<dimensions type="ruled" unit="mm">
 <height scope="most">90</height>
 <width scope="most">48</width>
</dimensions>
</egXML>
This indicates that for most leaves of the manuscript being described
the ruled space is 90 mm high and 48 mm wide, while the leaves throughout 
are between 157 and 160 mm in height and 105 mm in width.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msloc">
<head>References to locations within a manuscript</head>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is a specialized form of the <gi>ref</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="locus" atts="from to scheme targets"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is used to specify the location in the
manuscript occupied by the element within which it appears. If, for
example, it is used as the first component of a <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
element, or of any of the more specific elements appearing within one
(see further section <ptr target="#msco"/> below) then it is understood
to specify the location of that item within the manuscript being
described.</p>
<p>A <gi>locus</gi> element can be used to identify any reference to
one or more folios within a manuscript, wherever such a reference is
appropriate. Locations are conventionally specified as a sequence of
folio or page numbers, but may also be a discontinuous list, or a
combination of the two. This specification should be given as the
content of the <gi>locus</gi> element, using the conventions
appropriate to the individual scholar or holding institution, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus>ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>A normalized form of the location can also be
supplied, using special purpose attributes on the <gi>locus</gi>
element, as in the following revision of the above example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus from="1r" to="24r">ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <att>targets</att> attribute may be used to associate a
<gi>locus</gi> element with one or more other elements in the
current document, which should contain either a transcription of the
location indicated, or images of it, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>Most of the main body of the book (up to <locus targets="#txt182">fol. 
182v</locus>) was painted and decorated in one style, having links in 
style and iconography with the school of Maître François, although 
several of the miniatures in this section have been damaged and 
overpainted at a later date (e.g. the figure of Christ on 
<locus targets="http://www.images.fr#F33R">fol. 33r</locus>; the face of the 
Shepherdess on <locus targets="http://www.images.fr#F59V">fol. 59v</locus>, 
etc.).</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
The reference <val>#txt182</val> in this example is assumed to
reference the section of the manuscript <q>up to fol. 182v</q> which
has been transcribed elsewhere in the current document; the references
<val>http://www.images.fr#F33R</val> and
<val>http://www.images.fr#F59V</val> link to images of the
relevant pages, held presumably in an image archive.</p>
<!-- removed reference to more than one foliation, which lacked an example; should one be found it might be nice to add it. -->
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msnames">
<head>Names of persons, places, and organizations</head>
<!--<p>The standard TEI <gi>name</gi> element has an attribute
<att>type</att>, to indicate the type of name (e.g. personal name, place-name
etc.), <att>reg</att>, to provide a regularized form of the name, and <att>key</att>, to provide an identifying code or key for it. 
-->
<p>The standard TEI element <gi>name</gi> may be used to identify
names of any kind occurring within a description:
<specList>
<specDesc key="name" atts="type"/>
</specList>
As further discussed in <ptr target="#CONARS"/>, this element is a member of
the TEI class <ident type="class">att.naming</ident>, from which it
inherits the  <att>key</att> attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.naming"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <gi>name</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<name type="person">Thomas Hoccleve</name>
<name type="place">Villingaholt</name>
<name type="org">Vetus Latina Institut</name>
<name type="person" key="HOC001">Occleve</name>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note that the <gi>name</gi> element is defined as providing
information about a <emph>name</emph>, not the person, place, or organization to which that name refers. In the last example above, the <att>key</att> attribute is used to
associate the name with a more detailed description of the person
named, provided elsewhere using the standard TEI element <gi>person</gi>.
<specList>
<specDesc key="person"/>
</specList>
In order for this second Hoccleve example to be valid, a
<gi>person</gi> element must be provided which has the value
<code>HOCCL1</code> for its <att>xml:id</att> attribute; the same
value will be used as the <att>key</att> attribute of every reference
to Hoccleve in the document (however spelled), but there will only be
one <gi>person</gi> element with this identifier.</p>
<p>All the <gi>person</gi> elements referenced by a particular
document set should be collected together within a <gi>listPerson</gi>
<!-- need xref -->
element, located in the TEI Header. This functions as a kind
of prosopography for all the people referenced by the set of
manuscripts being described, in much the same way as a
<gi>listBibl</gi> element in the back matter may be used to hold
bibliographic information for all the works referenced.</p>
<p>Similar mechanisms may be used to create and maintain canonical
lists of places or organizations, but no specific elements are defined
for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmisc">
<head>Catchwords, signatures, secundo folio</head>
<p>The <gi>catchwords</gi> element is used to describe one method by
which correct ordering of the quires of a codex is ensured. Typically,
this takes the form of a word or phrase written in the lower margin of
the last leaf verso of a gathering, which provides a preview of the
first recto leaf of the successive gathering. This may be a simple
phrase such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catchwords>Quires signed on the last leaf verso in roman numerals.</catchwords>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain more details:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<catchwords>Vertical catchwords in the hand of the scribe placed along 
the inner bounding line, reading from top to bottom.</catchwords>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <soCalled>Signatures</soCalled> element is used, in a similar
way, to describe a similar  system in which quires or leaves are
marked  progressively  in order to facilitate arrangement during
binding. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>At the bottom of the first four leaves of quires 1-14 are 
  the remains of a series of quire signatures a-o plus roman figures in 
  a cursive hand of the fourteenth century.</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>signatures</gi> element can be used for either leaf
signatures, or a combination of quire and leaf signatures, whether the
marking is alphabetic, alphanumeric or some ad hoc system, as in the
following more complex example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>Quire and leaf signatures in letters, [b]-v, and roman numerals; 
those in quires 10 (1) and 17 (s) in red ink and different from others; 
every third quire also signed with red crayon in arabic numerals in the 
centre lower margin of the first leaf recto: "2" for quire 4 (f. 19), 
"3" for quire 7 (f. 43); "4", barely visible, for quire 10 (f. 65), "5", 
in a later hand, for quire 13 (f. 89), "6", in a later hand, for quire 
16 (f. 113).</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>secFol</gi> element (for <soCalled>secundo
folio</soCalled>) is used to record the opening word or words of the
second leaf of a manuscript. Since these words differ from one copy of
a text to another, the practice originated in the middle ages of using
them when cataloguing a manuscript in order to distinguish individual
copies of a work in a way which its opening words could not.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<secFol>(ando-)ssene in una villa</secFol><!-- better example needed -->
</egXML></p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mshera">
<head>Heraldry</head><!-- rename as armsDesc? -->
<p>Descriptions of heraldic arms, supporters, devices, and mottos may
appear at various points in the description of a manuscript, usually in the context of ownership
information, binding descriptions, or detailed accounts of
illustrations. A full description may also contain a detailed account of the
heraldic components of a manuscript independently considered. Frequently, however, heraldic descriptions will
be cited as short phrases within other parts of the record. The phrase
level element <gi>heraldry</gi> is provided to allow such phrases to
be marked for further  analysis, as in the following
examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p>Ownership stamp (xvii cent.) on i recto with the arms <heraldry>A bull 
passant within a bordure bezanty, in chief a crescent for difference</heraldry> 
[Cole], crest, and the legend <q>Cole Deum</q>.</p>
<!-- ... -->

</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div3">
<head>Formal definitions</head>
<p>The additional phrase-level elements are formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="xphrase.def">
&catchwords;
&dimensions;
&height;
&depth;
&width;
&heraldry;
&locus;
&material;
&origDate;

&stamp;
&watermark;
</specGrp></p>
</div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msid">
<head>The manuscript identifier</head>
<p>The <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element is intended to provide an
unambiguous means of uniquely identifying a particular
manuscript. This may be done in a structured way, by providing
 information about the holding institution and the call number,
shelfmark, or other identifier used to indicate its location within
that institution. Alternatively, or in addition, a manuscript may be
identified simply by a commonly used name.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
</specList></p>
<p>A manuscript's actual physical location may occasionally be
different from its place of ownership; at Cambridge University, for
example, manuscripts owned by various colleges are kept in the central
University Library. It is the ownership of the manuscript which should
be specified in the manuscript identifier, while additional or more
precise information on the physical location of the manuscript can be
given within the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>
<p>The following elements are available within <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
to identify the holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="country"/>
<specDesc key="region"/>
<specDesc key="settlement"/>
<specDesc key="institution"/>
<specDesc key="repository"/>
</specList></p>
<p>These elements are all structurally equivalent to the standard TEI
<gi>name</gi> element with an appropriate value for its
<att>type</att> attribute; however the use of this <soCalled>syntactic
sugar</soCalled> enables the model for <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to be
constrained rather more tightly than would otherwise be
possible. Specifically, only one of each of the elements listed above
may appear within the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and they must, if present,
appear in the order given.</p>
<p>These elements are all also members of the  attribute class
<ident type="class">att.naming</ident>, from which they inherit the following
attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.naming"/></specList></p>
<p>The following elements are used within <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to
provide different ways of identifying the manuscript within its holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="collection"/>
<specDesc key="idno"/>
<specDesc key="altIdentifier"/>
<specDesc key="msName"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Major manuscript repositories will usually have a preferred
form of citation for manuscript shelfmarks, including rules
about punctuation, spacing, abbreviation, etc., which should be
adhered to. Where such a format also contains information which might
additionally be supplied as a distinct subcomponent of the
<gi>msIdentifier</gi>, for example a collection name,
a decision must be taken as to whether to use the more specific
element, or to include within the <gi>idno</gi> element. For
example, the manuscript formally identified as <q>El 26 C 0</q> forms
a part of the Ellesmere (<q>El</q>) collection. Either of the
following encodings is therefore feasible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the former example, the preferred form of the identifier can be
retrieved by prefixing the content of the <gi>idno</gi> element with
that of the  <gi>collection</gi> element, while in the latter it is
given explicitly. The advantage of the former is that it it simplifies
accurate retrieval of all manuscripts from a given collection; the
disadvantage is that encoded abbreviations of this kind may not be as
immediately comprehensible. Care should be taken to avoid redundancy:
for example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> would clearly be inappropriate. Equally clearly, 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>Ellesmere</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> might be considered helpful in some circumstances (if, for
example, some of the items in the Ellsemere collection had shelfmarks
which did not begin <q>El</q>)</p>
<p>In cases where the shelfmark  contains no information about the
collection, it may be necessary to provide this explicitly, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region>New Jersey</region>
<settlement>Princeton</settlement>
<repository>Princeton University Library</repository>
<collection>Scheide Library</collection>
<idno>MS 71</idno>
<msName>Blickling Homiliary</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In these examples, <gi>msName</gi> has been used to provide
a common name other than the shelfmark by which a manuscript is
known. Where a manuscript has several such names, more than one of these elements may be used, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>Danmark</country>
<settlement>København</settlement>
<repository>Det Arnamagnæanske Institut</repository>
<idno>AM 45 fol.</idno>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Frisianus</msName>
<msName xml:lang="is">Fríssbók</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Here the globally available <att>xml:lang</att> attribute has been
used to specify the language of the alternative names. <!--This is a
standard TEI facility, which may be found useful in certain
environments (for example, when compiling a single catalogue from a
variety of originally different sources), but which may safely be
ignored in others. --><!-- is this second sentence necessary? --></p>
<p>In very rare cases a repository may have only one manuscript (or
only one of any significance), which will have no shelfmark as such
but will be known by a particular name or names. In such
circumstances, the <gi>idno</gi> element may be omitted, and the
manuscript identified by  the name or names used for it, using
one or more <gi>msName</gi> elements, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Rossano</settlement>
<repository xml:lang="it">Biblioteca arcivescovile</repository>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Rossanensis</msName>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex purpureus</msName> 
<msName xml:lang="en">The Rossano Gospels</msName> 
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where manuscripts have moved from one institution to another, or
even within the same institution, they may have identifiers additional
to the ones currently used, such as former shelfmarks, which are
sometimes retained even after they have been officially superseded. In
such cases it may be useful to supply an alternative identifier, with
a detailed structure similar to that of the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
itself. The following example shows a manuscript which had shelfmark
<code>II-M-5</code> in the collection of the Duque de Osuna, but which
now has the shelfmark <code>MS 10237</code> in the National Library in
Madrid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Madrid</settlement>
<repository>Biblioteca Nacional</repository>
<idno>MS 10237</idno>
<altIdentifier>
<region>Andalucia</region>
<settlement>Osuna</settlement>
<repository>Duque de Osuna</repository>
<idno>II-M-5</idno>
</altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Normally, such information would be dealt with under <gi>history</gi>, except in
cases where a manuscript is likely still to be referred to or known by
its former identifier. For example, an institution may have changed
its call number system but still wish to retain a record of the earlier
number, perhaps because the manuscript concerned is frequently cited in print
under its previous number:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Berkeley</settlement>
<institution>University of California</institution>
<repository>Bancroft Library</repository>
<idno>UCB 16</idno>
<altIdentifier><idno>2MS BS1145 I8</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Where (as in this example) no repository is specified for the
<gi>altIdentifier</gi>, it is assumed to be the same as that of the
parent <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. Where the holding institution has only
one preferred form of citation but wishes to retain the other for
internal administrative purposes, the secondary could be given within
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> with an appropriate value on the
<att>type</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Oxford</settlement>
<repository>Bodleian Library</repository>
<idno>MS. Bodley 406</idno>
<altIdentifier type="SC"><idno>2297</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
It might, however, be preferable to include such information within
the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>

<p>Cases of such changed or alternative identifiers should be clearly
distinguished from cases of <soCalled>scattered</soCalled>
manuscripts, that is to say manuscripts which although physically
disjoint are nevertheless generally treated as single units. One
well-known example is the Old Church Slavonic manuscript known as
<title>Codex Suprasliensis</title>, substantial parts of which are to
be found in three separate repositories, in Ljubljana, Warsaw, and
St. Petersburg. This should be represented using three distinct
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements, using an appropriate value on the
type attribute to indicate that these three identifiers are not
alternate ways of referring to the same physical object, but three
parts of the same entity.

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
  <msName xml:lang="la">Codex Suprasliensis</msName>
    <altIdentifier type="partial">
    <settlement>Ljubljana</settlement>
    <repository>Narodna in univerzitetna knjiznica</repository>

  </altIdentifier>
  <altIdentifier type="partial">

    <idno>BO 3.201</idno>
  </altIdentifier>
  <altIdentifier type="partial">

    <repository>Rossiiskaia natsional'naia biblioteka</repository>
    <idno>Q.p.I.72</idno>
  </altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the smallest possible description is one that
contains only the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi>; internally to that
element, the three subelements <gi>settlement</gi>,
<gi>repository</gi>, and <gi>idno</gi> are required, since they
provide what is, by common consent, the minimum amount of information
necessary to identify a manuscript.</p>

<p>The <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element and its constituents are formally
defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="msidentifier.def">
&msIdentifier;
&institution;
&repository;
&collection;
&altIdentifier;
&msName;</specGrp></p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msdo">
<head>The manuscript heading</head>
<p>Historically, the briefest possible meaningful description of a
manuscript consists of no more than a title,
e.g. <mentioned>Polychronicon</mentioned>. This will often have been
enough to identify a manuscript in a small collection because the
identity of the author is implicit. Where a title does not imply the
author, and is thus insufficient to identify the main text of a
manuscript, the author should be stated explicitly
(e.g. <mentioned>Augustinus, Sermones</mentioned> or <mentioned>Cicero,
Letters</mentioned>). Many inventories of manuscripts consist of no
more than an author and title, with some form of copy-specific
identifier, such as a shelfmark or <soCalled>secundo folio</soCalled> reference
(e.g. <mentioned>Arch. B. 3. 2: Evangelium Matthei cum
glossa</mentioned>, <mentioned>126. Isidori Originum libri
octo</mentioned>, <mentioned>Biblia Hieronimi, 2o fo. opus
est</mentioned>); information on date and place of writing will
sometimes also be included. The standard TEI element <gi>head</gi>
element can be used to provide a brief description of this kind.
<specList>
<specDesc key="head"/>
</specList>
In this way the cataloguer or scholar can supply in one place a
minimum of essential information, such as might be displayed or
printed as the heading of a full description. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head>Marsilius de Inghen, Abbreviata phisicorum Aristotelis; Italy, 1463.</head>
</egXML>
Any phrase-level elements, such as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>date</gi>, or the specialized elements <gi>origPlace</gi> and
<gi>origDate</gi>, can also be used within a <gi>head</gi> element,
but it should be remembered that the <gi>head</gi> element is intended
principally to contain a heading. More
structured information concerning the contents, physical form, or
history of the manuscript should be given within the specialized
elements described below, <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>physDesc</gi>,
<gi>history</gi>, etc. However, in simple cases, the <gi>p</gi>
element may also be used to supply an unstructured collection of
such information, as in the example given above (<ptr target="#msdesc"/>.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msco">
<head>Intellectual content</head>
<p>The <gi>msContents</gi> element is used to describe the
intellectual content of a manuscript or manuscript part. It comprises
<emph>either</emph> a series of informal prose paragraphs
<emph>or</emph> a series of <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
elements, each of which provides a more detailed description of a
single item contained within the manuscript. These may be prefaced, if
desired, by a <gi>summary</gi> element, which is especially useful
where one wishes to provide an overview of a manuscript's contents and
describe only some of the items in detail.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="msItem"/>
<specDesc key="msItemStruct"/>
</specList></p>
<p>In the simplest case, only a brief description may be provided, as
in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<p>A collection of Lollard sermons</p>
</msContents>
<msContents>
<p>Atlas of the world from Western Europe and Africa to Indochina, 
containing 27 maps and 26 tables</p>
</msContents>
<msContents>
<p>Biblia sacra: Antiguo y Nuevo Testamento, con prefacios, prólogos 
y argumentos de san Jerónimo y de otros. Interpretaciones de los 
nombres hebreos.</p>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>This description may of course be expanded to include any of the
TEI elements generally available within a <gi>p</gi> element, such as
<gi>title</gi>, <gi>bibl</gi>, or <gi>list</gi>. More usually,
however, each individual work within a manuscript will be given its
own description, using the <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
element described in the next section, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</egXML></p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mscoit"><head>The <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements</head>
<!-- I'm for killing off msItemStruct, personally -->
<p>Each discrete item in a manuscript or manuscript part can be described within a distinct <gi>msItem</gi> or <gi>msItemStruct</gi> element, and may be classified using the <att>class</att> attribute.</p>
<p>These are the possible component elements of <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi>.
<specList>
<specDesc key="author"/>
<specDesc key="respStmt"/>
<specDesc key="title" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="rubric"/>
<specDesc key="incipit"/>
<specDesc key="q" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="msItem"/>

<specDesc key="bibl"/>
<specDesc key="filiation"/>
<specDesc key="note" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="textLang"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The difference between <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is
that in the former, the order and number of child elements is not
constrained; any element, in other words, may be given in any order,
and repeated as often as necessary. In the latter, however, the
subelements, if used, must be given in the order specified above; they
may be repeated, with the exception of <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>incipit</gi>, and <gi>explicit</gi>, each of which can appear only
once. Neither <gi>msItem</gi> nor <gi>msItemStruct</gi> may contain 
untagged running text, although <gi>msItem</gi> may contain one or
more <gi>p</gi>
elements as an unstructured alternative to the possible components
listed above.  <gi>msItem</gi> and
<gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements may also nest, where a number of
separate items in a manuscript are grouped under a single title or
rubric, as is the case, for example, with a work like <mentioned>The
Canterbury Tales</mentioned>.</p>
<p>A <att>defective</att> attribute is available on
<gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>msItem</gi>, and <gi>msItemStruct</gi>, and
on the specialized elements for <gi>incipit</gi> and
<gi>explicit</gi>, with possible values of <code>true</code>,
<code>false</code>, <code>unknown</code>, or
<code>unspecified</code>. This can be used for example for collections
of fragments, where each fragment is given as a separate
<gi>msItem</gi> and the first and last words of each transcribed as
defective incipits and explicits, as in the following example, a
manuscript containing four fragments of a single work:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem defective="true"><locus from="1r" to="9v">1r-9v</locus>
<title>Knýtlinga saga</title>
<msItem n="1.1"><locus from="1r:1" to="2v:30">1r:1-2v:30</locus>
<incipit defective="true">dan<expan>n</expan>a a 
engl<expan>an</expan>di</incipit>
<explicit defective="true">en meðan har<expan>aldr</expan>

yf<expan>ir</expan> danmork</explicit>
</msItem>
<!-- msItems 1.2 to 1.4 -->
</msItem>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msat">
<head>Authors and titles</head>
<p>The <gi>title</gi> element should be used to supply a regularized
form of the item's title, as distinct from any rubric quoted from the
manuscript. If the item concerned has a standardized distinctive
title, e.g. <mentioned>Roman de la Rose</mentioned>, then this should
be the form given as content of the <gi>title</gi> element, with the
value of the <att>type</att> attribute given as
<code>uniform</code>. If no uniform title exists for an item, or none
has been yet identified, or if one wishes to provide a general
designation of the contents, then a <soCalled>supplied</soCalled>
title can be given, e.g. <mentioned>missal</mentioned>, in which case
the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>title</gi> should be given
the value <code>supplied</code>.</p>
<p>The <gi>author</gi> element, if used, should generally
contain the normalized form of an author's name, irrespective of how
(or whether) this form of the name is cited in the manuscript. If it
is desired to retain the form of the author's name as given in the
manuscript, this may be tagged as a distinct <gi>name</gi> element,
nested within the <gi>author</gi> element with the
normalized form of the name on its <att>reg</att>
attribute. Alternatively, the normalized form of the name may be
supplied as the value of a <att>reg</att> attribute on the 
<gi>author</gi> element.</p>
<!-- an example would be nice here -->
<p>Note that the <att>key</att> attribute can also be used, as on
names in general, to specify the identifier of a <gi>person</gi>
element carrying full details of the person concerned (see further
<ptr target="#msnames"/>).</p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can be used to supply the name and role of a person other than the author who is responsible for some aspect of the intellectual content of the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<author>Diogenes Laertius</author>
<respStmt>
<resp>in the translation of</resp>
<name>Ambrogio Traversari</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can also be used where there is a discrepancy between the author of an item as given in the manuscript and the accepted scholarly view, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<title type="supplied">Sermons on the Epistles and the Gospels</title>
<respStmt>
<resp>here erroneously attributed to</resp>
<name>St. Bonaventura</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
Note that such attributions of authorship, both correct and incorrect, are frequently found in the rubric or final rubric (and occasionally also elsewhere in the text), and can therefore be transcribed and included in the description, if desired, using the <gi>rubric</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi> or <gi>q</gi> elements, as appropriate.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3"><head>Rubrics, incipits, explicits, and other quotations from the text</head>
<p>It is customary in a manuscript description to record the opening
and closing words of a text as well as any headings or colophons it
might have, and the specialised elements <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, and
<gi>colophon</gi> are available within <gi>msItem</gi> for doing so,
along with the more general <gi>q</gi>, for recording other bits of
the text not covered by these elements. Each of these elements has the
same substructure, containing a mixture of phrase-level elements and
plain text. A <gi>locus</gi> element can be included within each, in
order to specify the location of the component, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem><locus>f. 1-223</locus>
<author>Radulphus Flaviacensis</author>
<title>Expositio super Leviticum </title>
<incipit><locus>f. 1r</locus>
Forte Hervei monachi</incipit>
<explicit><locus>f. 223v</locus>
Benedictio salis et aquae</explicit>
</msItem>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the following example, standard TEI elements for the transcription of primary sources have been used to mark
the expansion of abbreviations and other features present in the original:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem defective="true">
<locus>ff. 1r-24v</locus>
<title type="uniform">Ágrip af Noregs konunga sǫgum</title>

</msItem>
</egXML>
Note here also the use of the <att>defective</att> attribute on <gi>incipit</gi> and <gi>explicit</gi> to indicate that the text begins and ends defectively.
</p>
<p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute for <gi>colophon</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>q</gi>, and <gi>rubric</gi> may always be used to identify the language of the text quoted, if this is different from the default language specified by the <att>mainLang</att> attribute on <gi>textLang</gi>.</p>
</div>
<!-- I thought it might be nice to have something on filiation -->
<div type="div3" xml:id="msfil">
<head>Filiation</head>
<p>The <gi>filiation</gi> element can be used to provide information on the relationship between the manuscript and other surviving manuscripts of the same text, either specifically or in a general way, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem>
  <locus>118rb</locus>
  <incipit>Ecce morior cum nichil horum ... <ref>[Dn 13, 43]</ref>. Verba ista dixit Susanna de illis</incipit>

</msItem>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msclass">
<head>Text classification</head>
<p>One or more text classification or text-type codes may be
specified, either for the whole of the <gi>msContents</gi> element, or
for one or more of its constituent <gi>msItem</gi> elements, using the
<att>class</att> attribute as specified above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</msItem>
</msContents></egXML>
The value of the <att>class</att> attribute
should specify the identifier used for the appropriate classification
within a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element, defined in the <gi>classDecl</gi>
element of the TEI Header (<ptr target="#HD55"/>), as
shown here:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</taxonomy></classDecl>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mslangs">
<head>Languages and writing systems</head>
<p>The <gi>textLang</gi> element should be used to provide
information about the languages used within a manuscript item. It may take
the form of a simple note, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang>Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic script.</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where, for validation and indexing purposes, it is thought
convenient to add keywords identifying the particular languages used,
the <att>mainLang</att> attribute may be used, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="OCS">Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic 
script.</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<p>For this example to be valid, the identifier <ident>OCS</ident>
must also be predefined as the value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute

description.

</egXML>
<!-- here I would like to add the these two attributes are also available on msContents -->
</p>
<p>A manuscript item will sometimes contain material in more than one language. The 
<att>mainLang</att> attribute should be used only for the chief language. 
Other languages used may be specified using the <att>otherLangs</att>
attribute as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="OCS" otherLangs="RUS HEL">Mostly Old Church 
Slavonic, with some Russian and Greek material</textLang>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Since Old Church Slavonic may be written in either
Cyrillic or Glagolitic scripts, and even occasionally in both within the
same manuscript, it might be preferable to define identifiers which make
the distinction explicit. In such a case, the following <gi>textLang</gi>
element might be preferred:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang otherLangs="OCS-CYR OCS-GLA">Old Church Slavonic, 
written in Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts.</textLang>
</egXML>
and the following declarations might then be supplied in the <gi>langUsage</gi>
element of the associated TEI Header:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<langUsage>
<language ident="OCS-CYR">
Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic script.</language>
<language ident="OCS-GLA">
Old Church Slavonic, written in Glagolitic script.</language>
<!-- other languages used or referenced in the manuscript description -->
</langUsage>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note that the <gi>language</gi> element defines a particular
combination of human language and writing system. Only one
<gi>language</gi> element may be supplied for each such
combination. Standard TEI practice also allows this element to be
referenced by any element using the global <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute in order to specify the language applicable to the content
of that element. For example, assuming that <gi>language</gi>
elements have been defined with the identifiers <ident>fr</ident> (for
French), <ident>la</ident> (for Latin), and <ident>de</ident> (for
German), a manuscript description written in French which specifies
that a particular manuscript contains predominantly German but also
some Latin material, might
have a <gi>textLang</gi> element like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang xml:lang="fr" mainLang="de" otherLangs="la">allemand et latin</textLang>
</egXML></p>

<head>Physical description</head>
<p>Under the general heading <soCalled>physical description</soCalled>
we subsume a large number of different aspects generally regarded as
useful in the description of a given manuscript. These include aspects
of the form, support, extent, and quire structure of the manuscript
object and of the way in which the text is laid out on the page (<ptr target="#msph1"/>); the styles  of writing, such as the
way it is laid out on the page, the styles of writing,  decorative
features, any musical
notation employed and any annotations or marginalia (<ptr target="#msph2"/>); and discussion of its binding, seals, and any
accompanying material (<ptr target="#msph3"/>).</p>
<p>Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories
of information though few include them all, and not all distinguish
them as clearly as we propose here. In particular, it is often the
case that an existing description will include information for which
we propose distinct elements within a single paragraph, or even
sentence. The encoder must then decide whether to rewrite the
description using the structure proposed here, or to retain the
existing prose, marked up simply as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements,
directly within the <gi>physDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>The <gi>physDesc</gi> element may thus be used in either of two
distinct ways: it may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics
listed above and similar ones; or it may act as a container for any
choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of
this section, each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs,
and may also have more specific attributes. Note that the two ways
should, and indeed may, <emph>not</emph> be combined within the same
description.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msph1">
<head>Object description</head>
<p>The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is used to group together those
parts of the physical description which relate specifically to the
text-bearing object, its format, constitution, layout, etc. The
<att>form</att> attribute is used to indicate the specific type of
writing vehicle being described, for example, as a codex, roll,
tablet, etc. It has two parts: a description of the
<term>support</term>, i.e. the physical carrier on which the text is
inscribed; and a description of the <term>layout</term>, i.e. the way
text is organized on the carrier.</p>
<p>Taking these in turn, the description of the support is tagged
using the following elements, each of which is discussed in more
detail below:
<specList>
<specDesc key="supportDesc"/>
<specDesc key="support"/>
<specDesc key="extent"/>
<specDesc key="collation"/>
<specDesc key="foliation"/>
<specDesc key="condition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Each of these elements contains paragraphs relating to the topic
concerned. Within these paragraphs, phrase-level elements (in
particular those discussed above at <ptr target="#msphrase"/>),
may be used to tag specific terms of interest if so
desired.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<objectDesc form="codex">

<watermark>unicorn</watermark> (<ref>Briquet 9993</ref>) and 
<watermark>ox</watermark> (close to <ref>Briquet 2785</ref>). 
The first and last leaf of each quire, with the exception of 
quires xvi and xviii, are constituted by bifolia of parchment, 
and all seven miniatures have been painted on inserted 
singletons of parchment.</p>
</supportDesc>
</objectDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>This example combines information which might alternatively be more
precisely tagged using the more specific elements described in the
following subsections.</p>
<div type="div4">
<head>Support</head>
<p>The <gi>support</gi> element groups together information about the
physical carrier. Typically, for western manuscripts, this will entail
discussion of the material (parchment, paper, or a combination of the
two) written on. For paper, a discussion of any watermarks present may
also be useful.  If this discussion makes reference to standard
catalogues of such items, these may be tagged using the standard
<gi>ref</gi> element as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<support><p>
<material>Paper</material> with watermark: <watermark>anchor in a circle 
with star on top</watermark>, <watermark>countermark B-B with

<date>1570-1585</date>.</p></support>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4">
<head>Extent</head>
<p>The <gi>extent</gi> element, defined in the TEI header, may also be
used in a manuscript description to specify the number of
leaves a manuscript contains, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 97 + ii</extent>
</egXML>
Information regarding the size of the leaves may be
specifically marked using the phrase level <gi>dimensions</gi>
element, as in the following example, or left as plain prose.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 321 leaves 
<dimensions unit="cm">
<height>35</height>

</egXML></p>
<!-- use of measure here? i.e. something like:
<p>The standard TEI <gi>measure</gi> element, which has a <att>type</att> attribute to indicate the thing being measureed, can be used within <gi>extent</gi>, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</div>
<div type="div4">
<head>Collation</head>
<p>The <gi>collation</gi> element should be used to provide a
description of a book's current and original structure, that is, the
arrangement of its leaves and quires. This information may be conveyed
using informal prose, or any appropriate notational
convention. Although no specific notation is defined here, provision
is made for the tagging of such with the standard TEI <gi>formula</gi>
element. Here are some examples of different ways of treating collation:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collation><p><formula>1-3:8, 4:6, 5-13:8</formula></p></collation>

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphfo">
<head>Foliation</head>
<p>The <gi>foliation</gi> element may be used to indicate the scheme,
medium or location of folio, page, column, or line numbers written in
the manuscript, frequently including a statement about when and, if
known, by whom, the numbering was done.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphco">
<head>Condition</head>
<p>The <gi>condition</gi> element is used to summarize the overall
physical state of a manuscript, in particular where such information
is not recorded elsewhere in the description. It should not, however, be
used to describe changes or repairs to a manuscript, as these are more
appropriately described as a part of its custodial history (see <ptr target="#msadch"/>). 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<condition><p>The manuscript shows signs of damage from water and mould on its outermost leaves.</p></condition>
<condition><p>Despite tears on many of the leaves the codex is reasonably well preserved.

one leaf between ff. 193 and 194. The manuscript ends defectively (there are approximately six 
leaves missing).</p></condition>

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphla">
<head>Layout description</head>
<p>The second part of the <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is the
<gi>layoutDesc</gi> element, which is used to describe and document the
<foreign>mise-en-page</foreign> of the manuscript, that is the way in which text and illumination are arranged on the page, specifying for example the number of written, ruled, or
pricked lines and columns per page, size of margins,
distinct blocks such as glosses, commentaries, etc. This may be given as a simple
series of paragraphs. Alternatively, one or more different layouts
may be identified within a single manuscript, each described by its
own <gi>layout</gi> element. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="layoutDesc"/>
<specDesc key="layout"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Where the <gi>layout</gi> element is used, the layout will often be
sufficiently regular for the attributes on this element to convey all
that is necessary; more usually however a more detailed treatment will
be required. The attributes are provided as a convenient shorthand for
commonly occurring cases, and should not be used except where the
layout is regular. The value <code>NA</code> (not-applicable) should
be used for cases where the layout is either very irregular, or where
it cannot be characterized simply in terms of lines and columns, for
example, where blocks of commentary and text are arranged in a regular
but complex pattern on each page</p>
<p>The following examples indicate the range of possibilities:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<layout ruledLines="25 32">
<p>Most pages have between 25 and 32 long lines ruled in lead.</p>
</layout>
<layout columns="1" writtenLines="24">
<p>Written in one column throughout; 24 lines per page.</p>
</layout>
<layout><p>Written in 3 columns, with 8 lines of text and interlinear glosses in 
the centre, and up to 26 lines of gloss in the outer two columns. Double 
vertical bounding lines ruled in hard point on hair side. Text lines ruled 
faintly in lead. Remains of prickings in upper, lower, and outer (for 8 lines 
of text only) margins.</p></layout>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where multiple <gi>layout</gi> elements are supplied, the scope for
each specification can be indicated by means of <gi>locus</gi>
elements within the content of the element, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<layoutDesc>
<layout ruledLines="25 32">
<p>On <locus from="1r" to="202v">fols 1r-200v</locus> and <locus from="210r" to="212v">fols 210r-212v</locus> there are between 25 and 32 ruled lines.</p>
</layout>
<layout ruledLines="34 50">
<p>On <locus from="203r" to="209v">fols 203r-209v</locus> there are between 34

<div type="div3" xml:id="msph2">
<head>Writing, decoration, and other notations</head>
<p>The second group of elements within a structured physical description
concerns aspects of the writing, illumination, or other notation (notably, music) found
in a manuscript, including additions made in later hands — the <soCalled>text</soCalled>, as it were, as opposed to the carrier.

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphwr">
<head>Writing</head>
<p>The <gi>handDesc</gi> element can contain a short description of
the general characteristics of the writing observed in a manuscript, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc>
<p>Written in a <term>late Caroline minuscule</term>; versals in a 
form of <term>rustic capitals</term>; although the marginal and 
interlinear gloss is written in varying shades of ink that are 
not those of the main text, text and gloss appear to have been 
copied during approximately the same time span.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note the use of the <gi>term</gi> element to mark specific technical
terms within the context of the <gi>handDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>Where several distinct hands have been identified, this fact can be registered by using the <att>hands</att> attribute, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="2">
<p>The manuscript is written in two contemporary hands, otherwise
unknown, but clearly those of practised scribes. Hand I writes
ff. 1r-22v and hand II ff. 23 and 24. Some scholars, notably
Verner Dahlerup and Hreinn Benediktsson, have argued for a third hand
on f. 24, but the evidence for this is insubstantial.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Alternatively, or in addition, where more specific
information about one or more of the hands identified is to be recorded,
the <gi>handNote</gi> element should
be used, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="3">
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-1" scope="minor">
<p>The first part of the manuscript,

<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-2" scope="major">
<p>The second part of the manuscript, <locus from="72v:4" to="194v">fols

<ref target="#AM02-20-b-II">AM 20b II fol.</ref>.</p></handNote>
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-3" scope="minor">

</handDesc>
</egXML>
Note here the use of the <gi>locus</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msloc"/>, to specify exactly which parts of a
manuscript are written by a given hand.</p>
<p>When a full or partial transcription of a manuscript is available
in addition to the manuscript description, the 
<gi>handShift</gi> element described in <ptr target="#PHDH"/> can be used
to link the relevant parts of the transcription to the 
appropriate <gi>handNote</gi> element in the description.

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphdec">
<head>Decoration</head>
<p>It can be difficult to draw a clear distinction between aspects of
a manuscript which are purely physical and those which form part of
its intellectual content. This is particularly true of illuminations
and other forms of decoration in a manuscript. We propose the
following elements for the purpose of delimiting discussion of these
aspects within a manuscript description, and for convenience locate
them all within the physical description, despite the fact that the
illustrative features of a manuscript will in many cases also be seen
as constitutiing part of its intellectual content.</p>
<p>The <gi>decoDesc</gi> element may contain simply one or more
paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the decorative features
of the manuscript, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>The decoration comprises two full page miniatures, perhaps added 
by the original owner, or slightly later; the original major decoration
consists of twenty-three large miniatures, illustrating the divisions of 
the Passion narrative and the start of the major texts, and the major 
divisions of the Hours; seventeen smaller miniatures, illustrating the 
suffrages to saints; and seven historiated initials, illustrating
the pericopes and major prayers.</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain a series of more specific typed
<gi>decoNote</gi> elements, each summarizing a particular aspect or
individual instance of the decoration present, for example the use of
miniatures, initials (historiated or otherwise), borders, diagrams,
etc., as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<decoNote type="miniature">
<p>One full-page miniature, facing the beginning of the first 
Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote> 
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>One seven-line historiated initial, commencing the first 
Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>Six four-line decorated initials, commencing the second through the 
seventh Penitential Psalm.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="initial">
<p>Some three hundred two-line versal initials with pen-flourishes, 
commencing the psalm verses.</p>
</decoNote>
<decoNote type="border">
<p>Four-sided border decoration surrounding the miniatures and three-sided 
border decoration accompanying the historiated and decorated initials.</p>
</decoNote>
</decoDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where more exact indexing of the decorative content of a manuscript
is required, the standard TEI elements <gi>term</gi> or <gi>index</gi>
may be used within the prose description to supply or delimit
appropriate iconographic terms, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<decoNote type="miniatures">
<p>Fourteen large miniatures with arched tops, above five lines of text:

<head>Additions and marginalia</head>
<p>The <gi>additions</gi> element can be used to list or describe any
additions to the manuscript, such as marginalia, scribblings, doodles,
etc., which are considered to be of interest or importance. Such
topics may also be discussed or referenced elsewhere in a description,
for example in the <gi>history</gi> element, in cases where the
marginalia provide evidence of ownership. Some examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<additions><p>Doodles on most leaves, possibly by children, and often quite amusing.</p></additions>
<additions><p>Quelques annotations marginales des XVIe et XVIIe s.</p></additions>
<additions>
<p>The text of this manuscript is not interpolated with sentences from 
Royal decrees promulgated in 1294, 1305 and 1314. In the margins, however, 
another somewhat later scribe has added the relevant paragraphs of these 
decrees, see pp. 8, 24, 44, 47 etc.</p>
<p>As a humorous gesture the scribe in one opening of the manuscript, pp. 36 
and 37, has prolonged the lower stems of one letter f and five letters þ 
and has them drizzle down the margin.</p>
</additions>
<additions>
<p>Spaces for initials and chapter headings were left by the scribe but not filled in. 
A later, probably fifteenth-century, hand has added initials and chapter headings in 
greenish-coloured ink on fols <locus>8r</locus>, <locus>8v</locus>, <locus>9r</locus>, 
<locus>10r</locus> and <locus>11r</locus>. Although a few of these chapter headings are

<head>Binding descriptions</head>
<p>The <gi>bindingDesc</gi> element contains a description of the state of
the present and former bindings of a manuscript, including information
about its material, any distinctive marks, and provenance information. This may
be given as a series of paragraphs, if only one binding is being described, or
as a series of distinct <gi>binding</gi> elements, each describing a distinct
binding, where these are separately described. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<bindingDesc>
<p>Sewing not visible; tightly rebound over 19th-century pasteboards, reusing 
panels of 16th-century brown leather with gilt tooling à la fanfare, Paris 
c. 1580-90, the centre of each cover inlaid with a 17th-century oval medallion 
of red morocco tooled in gilt (perhaps replacing the identifying mark of a 
previous owner); the spine similarly tooled, without raised bands or title-piece; 
coloured endbands; the edges of the leaves and boards gilt. Boxed.</p>
</bindingDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Within a binding description, the element <gi>decoNote</gi> is
available, as an alternative to <gi>p</gi>, for paragraphs dealing
exclusively with information about decorative features of a binding,
as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding><p>Bound, s. XVIII (?), in <material>diced russia leather</material>
retaining most of the original 15th century metal ornaments (but with 
some replacements) as well as the heavy wooden boards.</p>
<decoNote><p>On each cover: alternating circular stamps of the Holy Monogram, 
a sunburst, and a flower.</p></decoNote> 
<decoNote><p>On the cornerpieces, one of which is missing, a rectangular stamp 
of the Agnus Dei.</p></decoNote> 
<p>Rebacked during the 19th century.</p>
</binding>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphse">
<head>Seals</head>
<p>The <gi>sealDesc</gi> element supplies information about the
seal(s) attached to documents to guarantee their integrity, or to show
authentication of the issuer or consent of the participants. It may
contain one or more paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the
seals, or may contain one or more <gi>seal</gi> elements.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<head>Accompanying material</head>
<p>The circumstance may arise where material not originally part of a
manuscript is bound into or otherwise kept with a manuscript. In some
cases this material would best be treated in a separate
<gi>msPart</gi> element (see <ptr target="#mspt"/> below).  There are,
however, cases where the additional matter is not self-evidently a
distinct manuscript: it might, for example, be a set of notes by a
later scholar, or a file of correspondence relating to the
manuscript. The <gi>accMat</gi> element is provided as a holder for
this kind of information.
<specList>
<specDesc key="accMat"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of this element, describing a note by
the Icelandic manuscript collector Árni Magnússon which
has been bound with the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<accMat>
<p>A slip in Árni Magnússon's hand has been stuck to the
pastedown on the inside front cover; the text reads:

<head>History</head>
<p>The following elements are used to record information about the history of a manuscript:
<specList>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="origin"/>
<specDesc key="provenance"/>
<specDesc key="acquisition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The three components of the <gi>history</gi> element all have the
same substructure, consisting of one or more paragraphs marked as
<gi>p</gi> elements. Each of these three elements is also a member of
the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> attribute class, itself a
member of the <name type="class">att.datable.w3c</name> class, and
thus also carries the following optional attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.datable.w3c" atts="notBefore notAfter">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>Information about the origins of the manuscript, its place and date
of writing, should be given as one or more paragraphs contained by a
single <gi>origin</gi> element; following this, any available
information on distinct stages in the history of the manuscript before
its acquisition by its current holding institution should be included
as paragraphs within one or more <gi>provenance</gi>
elements. Finally, any information specific to the means by which the
manuscript was acquired by its present owners should be given as
paragraphs within the <gi>acquisition</gi> element.</p>
<p>Here is a fairly simple example of the use of this element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<history>
<origin><p>Written in <origPlace>Durham</origPlace> during <origDate notBefore="1125" notAfter="1175">the mid-twelfth century</origDate>.</p></origin>

<date>1738</date> by <name type="person">Thomas Gale</name> and 
his son <name type="person">Roger</name>.</p></acquisition>
</history>
</egXML></p>
<p>Here is a fuller example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<history>
<origin notBefore="1225" notAfter="1275">
<p>Written in Spain or Portugal in the middle of the 13th century

<provenance><p>The Spanish scholar <name type="person">Benito Arias

name twice, once on the front pastedown and once on f. 1r, the former dated
<date>1680</date> and the latter <date>1682</date>. Following Parsberg's 
death the manuscript was bought by <foreign>etatsråd</foreign>
<name type="person">Jens Rosenkrantz</name> (1640-1695) when Parsberg's
library was auctioned off (23 October 1693).</p></provenance>
<acquisition notBefore="1696" notAfter="1697"><p>The manuscript was acquired by Árni

<specDesc key="adminInfo"/>

<p>None of the constituent elements of <gi>additional</gi> is
required. If any is supplied, it may appear once only; furthermore,
the order in which elements are supplied should be as specified above.</p>
<p>The <gi>additional</gi> element is formally defined as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="additional.def">

</specGrp></p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msadad">
<head>Administrative information</head>
<p>A variety of information relating to the curation and management of
a manuscript may be recorded as simple prose narrative tagged using
the standard <gi>p</gi> element. Alternatively, different aspects of this
information may be presented grouped within one or more
of the following specialized elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="recordHist"/>
<specDesc key="availability"/>
<specDesc key="custodialHist"/>
</specList></p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msrh">
<head>Record history</head>
<p>The <gi>recordHist</gi> element, if supplied, must contain a
<gi>source</gi> element, followed by an optional series of
<gi>change</gi> elements. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="source"/>
<specDesc key="change"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>source</gi> element is used to document the primary source
of information for the record containing it, in a similar
way to the standard TEI <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element within a TEI
Header. If the record is a new one, made without reference to anything
other than the manuscript itself, then it may simply contain a <gi>p</gi>
element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<source><p>Directly catalogued from the original manuscript.</p></source>
</egXML></p>
<p>Frequently, however, the record will be derived from some
previously existing description, which may be specified using the
standard TEI <gi>bibl</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<recordHist>
<source><p>Information transcribed from <bibl><title>The index of Middle English verse</title><biblScope>123</biblScope></bibl>.</p></source>
</recordHist>
</egXML></p>
<p>If, as is likely, a full bibliographic description of the source
from which cataloguing information was taken is included within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element contained by the current <gi>additional</gi>
element, or elsewhere in the current document, then it need not be
repeated here. Instead, it should be referenced using the standard TEI
<gi>ref</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><additional>
  <adminInfo>
    <recordHist>
    <source>
      <p>Information transcribed from 
        <bibl><ref target="#IMEV">IMEV</ref> 123</bibl>.</p>

      <date>1943</date>
    </bibl>
    <!-- other bibliographic records relating to this manuscript here -->
  </listBibl>
</additional>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>change</gi> element is a standard TEI element, which
may also appear within the <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element of the
standard TEI Header; its use here is intended to signal the
similarity of function between the two container elements. Where the
TEI Header should be used to document the revision history of the
whole electronic file to which it is prefixed, the <gi>recordHist</gi>
element may be used to document changes at a lower level, relating to
the individual description, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<change date="2005-03-10">On 10 March 2005
<name>MJD</name> converted to P5</change>
</egXML></p>
</div><div type="div4" xml:id="msadch">
<head>Availability and custodial history</head>
<p>The <gi>availability</gi> element is a standard TEI element,
which should be used here to supply any information concerning
access to the current manuscript, such as its physical location (where this
is not implicit in its identifier), any restrictions on access, information
about copyright, etc.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<availability>

</availability>
<availability>
<p>The manuscript is in poor condition, due to many of the leaves being 
brittle and fragile and the poor quality of a number of earlier repairs; 
it should therefore not be used or lent out until it has been conserved.</p>
</availability>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>custodialHist</gi> record is used to describe the custodial
history of a manuscript, recording any significant events noted during
the period that it has been located within its holding institution. It
may contain either a series of paragraphs tagged with the standard TEI
<gi>p</gi> element, or a series of <gi>custEvent</gi> elements, each
describing a distinct incident or event, further specified by a
<att>type</att> attribute, and carrying dating information by virtue
of its membership in the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, as noted above.
<specList>
<specDesc key="custEvent"/>

<p>Here is an example of the use of this element:

to provide information about any digital or photographic
representations of the manuscript which may exist within the holding
institution or elsewhere. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="surrogates"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element should not be used to repeat
information about representations of the manuscript available within
published works; this should normally be documented within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element within the <gi>additional</gi>
element. However, it is often also convenient to record information
such as negative numbers, digital identifiers etc. for unpublished
collections of manuscript images maintained within the holding
institution, as well as to provide more detailed descriptive
information about the surrogate itself. Such information may be provided
as prose paragraphs, within which identifying information about particular
surrogates may be presented using the standard TEI <gi>bibl</gi> element,
as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<surrogates>
<p>
<bibl><title type="gmd">microfilm (master)</title><idno>G.neg. 160</idno> n.d.</bibl>

</bibl>
</p>
</surrogates>
</egXML>
Note the use of the specialized form of title (<term>general material designation</term>) to specify the kind of surrogate being documented.</p>
<p>At a later revision, the content of the <gi>surrogates</gi> element
is likely to be expanded to include elements more specifically
intended to provide detailed information such as technical details of
the process by which a digital or photographic image was made.</p>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element is formally defined as follows:

originally physically separate manuscripts or parts of manuscripts
have been bound together and/or share the same call number.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Since each component of such a composite manuscript will in all
likelihood have its own content, physical description, history, and so
on, the structure of <gi>msPart</gi> is in the main identical to that
of <gi>msDescription</gi>, allowing one to retain the top level of
identity (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>), but to branch out thereafter into as
many parts, or even subparts, as necessary. If the parts of a
composite manuscript have their own identifiers, they should be tagged
using the <gi>idno</gi> element, rather than the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
