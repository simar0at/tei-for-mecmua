<p>As discussed in chapter <ptr target="#TD"/>, the modules making up
the TEI scheme are generated from a single set of XML source
files. Schemas can be generated for TEI customizations
in each of XML DTD language, W3C schema language,
and RELAX NG schema language. In the body of the Guidelines, only
the latter form is presented, using the compact syntax. </p>

<p>The TEI schemas and Guidelines are widely available over the
Internet and elsewhere.  The canonical home for the TEI source, the
schema fragments generated from it, and example modifications, is the
TEI repository at <ptr target="http://tei.sf.net"/>;
versions are also available in other formats, along with copies of the
Guidelines and related materials, from the TEI web site at <ptr
target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.</p>
