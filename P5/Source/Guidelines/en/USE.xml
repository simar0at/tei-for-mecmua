<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This chapter discusses several
related  technical topics concerning the actual deployment of the TEI
markup scheme documented elsewhere in these Guidelines. The TEI scheme
is intended both to support best current practice and to facilitate
enhancement and customization of that practice. In section <ptr
target="#MD"/> we discuss the scope and variety of the TEI
customization mechanisms, distinguishing between
<soCalled>clean</soCalled> modifications, which result in a schema
that supports a subset of the distinctions made in the full TEI
system, on the one hand, from <soCalled>unclean</soCalled>
modifications, which result in a schema that does not have this
property. In section <ptr target="#CF"/> we define the notion of
<term>TEI Conformance</term>, distinguishing between documents which
are algorithmically TEI conformant  from those which are intrinsically
conformant; we also define the concept of a conformant TEI
extension. Since the ODD markup description language defined in chapter
<ptr target="#TD"/> is fundamental  to the way conformance and
customization are handled in the TEI system, these two definitional
sections are followed by a section which describes in further detail
the intended behaviour of an ODD processor. The chapter concludes with
a similarly advisory section which discusses best practice in using
the Guidelines to support markup of non-hierarchic overlapping
structures (<ptr target="#NH"/>). </p>
