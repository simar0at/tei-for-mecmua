and Acknowledgments</head>

<p>This publication constitutes the fifth distinct version of the
<title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange</title>, and the first complete revision since the
appearance of P3 in 1994. It includes substantial amounts of new
material and a major revision of the underlying technical
infrastructure. With this version, the Guidelines enter a new stage in
their development as a community-maintained open source project. This
edition is the first version to have benefitted from the close
overview and oversight of an elected TEI Technical Council.  The
editors are therefore particularly pleased to acknowledge with
gratitude the hard work and dedication put into this project by the
Council over the last five years.
</p>

<p>The Chair of the TEI Board sits on the Technical Council, and the
Board also nominates one other member to the Council. The other
Council members are all elected by the Consortium membership, and
serve periods of up to two years at a time.  The Board nominates the
Chair of the Technical Council from among its members.  <!-- The TEI
Council's Chair and one other member are nominated by the Board of the
TEI Consortium, with other members being elected for periods of up to
two years at a time. -->The names and affiliations of all Council
members who served during the production of this edition of the
Guidelines are listed below.
