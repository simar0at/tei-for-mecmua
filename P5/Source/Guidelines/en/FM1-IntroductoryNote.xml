and Acknowledgments</head>

<p>This publication constitutes the fifth distinct version of the
<title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange</title>, and the first complete revision since the
appearance of P3 in 1994. It includes substantial amounts of new
material and a major revision of the underlying technical
infrastructure. With this version, the Guidelines enter a new stage in
their development as a community-maintained open source project. This
edition is the first version to have benefitted from the close
overview and oversight of an elected TEI Technical Council.  The
editors are therefore particularly pleased to acknowledge with
gratitude the hard work and dedication put into this project by the
Council over the last five years.
</p>

 <p>The Chair of the TEI Board sits on the Technical Council, and the Board
  appoints the Chair of the Technical Council and one other member of the
  Council. Other Council members are all elected by the Consortium
  membership, and serve periods of up to two years at a time.  <!-- The TEI
Council's Chair and one other member are nominated by the Board of the
TEI Consortium, with other members being elected for periods of up to
two years at a time. -->The names and affiliations of all Council
members who served during the production of this edition of the
Guidelines are listed below.

 <p>From 2000 to 2008 the TEI had two appointed Editors, Lou Burnard (University of Oxford) and Syd Bauman
(Brown University), who served <foreign>ex officio</foreign> on the Council and, as far as
possible, on all Council workgroups.</p>


<p>The council also oversees an Internationalization and Localization
project, led by Sebastian Rahtz and with funding from the ALLC. This
activity, ongoing since October 2005, is engaged in translating key
parts of the P5 source into a variety of languages.</p>

<p>Production of the translations currently included in P5 has been
coordinated by the following: 
<list type="gloss">

<p>Any one who works closely with the TEI Guidelines, whether as
translator, editor, or reader is constantly reminded of the
ambitious scope and exceptionally high editorial standards set by the original
project, now approaching twenty years ago. It is appropriate therefore to retain
a sense of the history of this document, as it has evolved since its
first appearance in 1990, and to acknowledge with gratitude the
contributions made to that evolution by very many individuals and
institutions around the world. The original prefatory notes to each
major edition of the Guidelines recording these names are therefore
preserved in an appendix to the current edition (see  <ptr
target="#PREFS"/>).</p>
