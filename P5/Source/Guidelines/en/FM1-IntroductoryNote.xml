<p>This publication constitutes the fifth distinct version of the
<title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange</title>, and the first complete revision since the
appearance of P3 in 1994. It includes substantial amounts of new
material and a major revision of the underlying technical
infrastructure. With this version, the Guidelines also enter a
new stage in their development as a community-maintained open source
project: it is the first version to have benefitted from the close
overview and oversight of an elected 
TEI Technical Council.  The editors are therefore particularly pleased
to acknowledge with gratitude the hard work and dedication put into
this project by the Council over the last five years.
</p>

<p>The TEI Council's Chair and one other member are nominated by the
Board of the TEI Consortium, with other members being elected for
periods of up to two years at a time. The names and affiliations of
all Council members who served during the production of this edition
of the Guidelines are listed below; gratias eis agenda!
