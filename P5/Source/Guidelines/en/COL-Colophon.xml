<p>The text of this manual was prepared electronically on a variety of
systems.  Most sections were originally drafted by members of the work
groups and working committees of the TEI; all have been revised by the
editors to achieve greater uniformity of style and greater consistency
in the tag set.</p>

<p>The web release of the Guidelines was created using a library of
XSLT stylesheets to convert to XHTML; the PDF version for printing was
produced by conversion to LaTeX markup, processed using XeLaTeX.
The XSLT libraries were written by Sebastian Rahtz.</p>


<p>Almost every available SGML and XML editor or processing program
has been used at one time or another by the TEI; but
without the open source implementations of XML parsers, editors and
XSLT engines by James Clark, Richard Stallman, Michael Kay, and Daniel
Veillard, the TEI could not survive, and we thank these
individuals. We would also like to thank the staff at Syncrosoft,
creators of the oXygen editor, for their  support for the TEI during
the creation on P5.</p>

<p>Many volunteers contributed to the preparation of this release of
the Guidelines; we particularly note the work of Sabine Krott, Eva
Radermacher and Arianna Ciula for their work in structuring the
bibliographies.</p>

<p>The production and release process for TEI P5 was managed by
Sebastian Rahtz for the TEI Technical Council.</p>
