<head>Colophon</head>
<p>The text of this manual was prepared electronically on a variety of
systems.  Most sections were originally drafted by members of the work
groups and working committees of the TEI; all have been revised by the
editors to achieve greater uniformity of style and greater consistency
in the tag set.</p>

<p>Tags from the schema documented here were introduced in the text by
the original drafters of the sections or by the editors, using
standard text editors on various systems over the years, include VMS,
VM/CMS, DOS, Macintosh, Windows, Solaris and Linux systems.  The
resulting document fragments were validated using many different SGML
and XML tools throughout the life of the TEI, starting with the SGML
validators VM2 (a markup validator distributed with the public-domain
ARCSGML materials), sgmls (parser built on the same engine), Markit,
Checkmark, XGML Validator; and then moving to the XML validators
nsgmls (James Clark), rxp (Richard Tobin), and libxml2 (Daniel Veillard).
The validated files, which contained both the prose
description of the tag set and the reference materials, were then
processed with ad hoc programs written originally in Spitbol and then
rewritten in XSLT to produce separate documents for the text of the
Guidelines, the reference section, and the schemas; the documentation
was then transformed to variously Waterloo GML, LaTeX, and XSL FO for
formatting and printing, and to HTML and XHTML for the web.</p>

<p>Without the open source implementations of XML parsers, editors and
XSLT engines by James Clark, Richard Stallman, Michael Kay, and Daniel
Veillard, the TEI could not survive, and we thank these individuals.</p>

<p>The camera ready copy of the 1992â€“1996 versions of
this document was produced by Waterloo Script
GML running on the IBM 3090 at the University of Illinois at Chicago
Academic Computer Center (to which thanks), and using a set of
macros extending the GML Starter Set of tags with specialized tags
designed for this document. Later interim versions were produced by a
translation to LaTeX.</p>

<p>The 2001 P4 release of the Guidelines was typeset by transforming
the TEI XML source to an XML file containing XSL Formatting Objects,
which was then formatted using the PassiveTeX implementation of XSL
Formatting Objects by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. The
underling engine was the pdfTeX extension of TeX by Han The Thanh. The
main font used was Times Roman, with Computer Modern Sans-serif and
Lucida-Sans Typewriter as needed.
</p>

<p>The 2006 P5 release of the Guidelines was formatted to XHTML
using a library of XSLT stylesheets, and PDF versions for printing
were producing by conversions to LaTeX markup, processing using
XeLaTeX.
