<head>Implementation of an ODD System</head>
<p>This chapter specifies how a processing system may take advantage
of the markup specification elements documented in chapter <ptr
target="#TD"/> of these Guidelines in order to produce
<list type="ordered">
<item>project specific user documentation</item>
<item>schemas in one or more schema languages</item>
<item>validation tools for other processors</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The specifications in this chapter are illustrative but not
normative. Its function is to further illustrate the intended scope
and application of the elements documented in chapter <ptr
target="#TD"/>, since it is believed that these may have application
beyond the areas directly addressed by the TEI.</p>
