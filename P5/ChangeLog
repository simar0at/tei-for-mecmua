2005-02-15  sbauman  <sbauman@sbauman>

	* Source/CO/biblitem.odd:
	Changed gloss (again?), added <title> as a child, improved 1st xmp.

2005-02-14  sbauman  <sbauman@sbauman>

	* Source/CO/biblitem.odd:
	Fixed a few typos, changed values of form= to a proper <valList>.

2005-02-12  sbauman  <sbauman@sbauman>

	* Source/HD/broadcas.odd, Source/HD/scrstmt.odd, Source/HD/soustmt.odd, Source/HD/taxonomy.odd, Source/CO/biblitem.odd, Source/CO/biblstru.odd:
	Minor updates to <biblItem> itself, examples in main Guidelines still invalid

2005-02-10  sbauman  <sbauman@sbauman>

	* fileents.dtd, Source/CC/cc.odd, Source/CO/biblitem.odd, Source/CO/co.odd, Source/HD/hd.odd, ents.dtd:
	Begin process of changing <biblStruct> to <biblItem>

2005-02-08  sbauman  <sbauman@sbauman>

	* Makefile:
	Separate out the schema generation part of the 'validation' target
	from the rest, so that we can just re-validate w/o re-generating the
	schemas quite easily. The target 'validate' still does the same thing
	it used to: generate schemas and validate against them. A new target,
	'valid', performs only validation, w/o schema generation.

2005-02-08  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Test/testmathml.xml, guidelines.xsl, tei-print.css, tei.css, guidelines-print.xsl, Makefile:
	redo Guidelines to be more portable and printable

2005-02-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Test/Makefile: forget XSD on mixed-namespace

2005-02-06  louburnard  <louburnard@spqr-ibm>

	* Test/testdictionaries.xml, Test/testmathml.xml:
	added correct dtdeclarations

2005-02-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Test/Makefile: rationalize tests to what actually might work

	* Test/Makefile: ignore xmllint but test xsd

	* Source/SA/joingrp.odd, Source/SA/ptrgroup.odd, Test/testdictionaries.odd, ChangeLog, VERSION:
	datatype issue; Name was not being recognised, so change to NCName

2005-02-06  louburnard  <louburnard@spqr-ibm>

	* Source/CO/co.odd:
	 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	 remove repeated word

2005-02-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Test/testdictionaries.odd, Test/testlite.odd:
	syntax errors in ODD files for dictionaries and lite

	* Source/MS/source.odd: missing # on local target

2005-02-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* in joingrp and ptrgroup, dont use datatype Name, but NCName
	* add hash before an example in MS
	* update Test files

2005-01-16  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Makefile: when making normal and example schemas, omit xsd, dtd
	and doc
	* Roma: allow for omitting xsd, doc and dtd creation with new
	options; define "die" function
	* Test/testoucs.odd, Test/testp4compat.odd: when adding "id", make
	it text, to avoid having two atts of type ID. removing xml:id
	makes trang produce gibberish


2005-01-15  Lou Burnard  <lou@thimk>

	* Test/testlite.xml and others that cant work with just a DTD
	subset modified to invoke compiled dtd explicitly

	* CO/list.odd content model simplified by removing some optional
	tei.Incls 

	* HD/eddecl.odd content model changed to allow either paras or
	members of new tei.policy class but not a mixture

	* ST/policy.odd new class added; consisting of all previously explicitly-named
	children of editorialDecl

2005-01-15  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>

	* Source/ST/global.odd: make datatypes of xml:base and
	xml:lang point direct to W3C datatypes, not redirects, to simplify
	XSD output

	* Roma: add a lot more error checking and make sure it survives
	relative directories. clean up xml.xsd after creating it

	* Test/Makefile, Test/testdictionaries.xml, Test/testfs.xml, ChangeLog, Source/ST/tei2.odd, Source/ST/teicorp2.odd:
	test files and add xmlns to teiCorpus

	* Source/ST/teicorp2.odd: add xmlns attribute to teiCorpus

2005-01-14  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr>

	* Started work in CVS on Sourceforge

	HIC DESUNT MULTA since 2004/10/01

2004-10-01  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-ibm>
	* odd2relax.xsl and teiodds.xsl: bug fixes here and there to cater
	for below
	* teicommon.xsl: some un-namespaced remnants corrected
	* classSpec.odd: allow for a <content> child, to contain a
   	   starting declaration (defaults to <notAllowed/>)
        * schemaspec.odd: add attribute "start" to generate Relax NG start
	   statements (can be NMTOKENS, for multiple choices). modules
	   do not now generate a start at all.
	* figure.odd: make url and doc attributes of figure be a choice, not allowed together
	* moduleref.odd:  make url and key attributes be a choice, not
	  allowed together. also allow children (if using @url)
	* orig.odd/reg.odd: put in correct classes for <choice>
	
2004-06-01  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	Change 43901 submitted.
	* Source/ST/st.odd: dftana and dftlink not needed; done by
	"predeclare" attribute on all classes which are needed up front.

	* remove all remaining <claDecl> elements, in favour of
	predeclaration

	* juggle order of macros to make them appear in right order

	* cbcomp should be in "tei" module not "core"

2004-05-31  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Tools/dtdGen.xsl: considerably simplify processing model:
	visit every module in turn, and process the elements, classes and
	macros which occur it it. Unless it has a type value of "core", in
	which case it gets special treatment. At that point, declare a
	marked section for every module, set to IGNORE. This means that
	all modules must be explicitly requested.

	* Source/PR/pr.odd (fragment): omit "prose" module entirely, as it
	does nothing

	* Source/ST/inherit.odd: kill this one. not used any more.
	
	* Source/TD/msection.odd: kill the whole concept.
	
	* Source/ST/st.odd: 
	  - entirely kill marked sections for XML/SGML omissability. embed
	    that in XSLT DTD generator directly.
	  - kill marked sections guarding modules. Will now be generated.
	  - kill mixno.odd. Everything is mixed now.

2004-05-30  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>
	CHANGE 43890 committed

	* all .odd files: change copyright notice

	* all *Spec: add "module" attribute showing their rightful home
	 (implemented in P5transform.xsl/transformbody.xsl)

	* unusedSource/*: move over to here any .odd files which
	 cease to be used.

	CHANGE 43889 committed
	
	* Source-driver.xml: add copyright statement

	CHANGE 43888 committed

	* Source/TD/identify.odd: add "module" attribute to specify
	  which module an object is defined it

	* Source/DI/di.odd, VE/ve.odd, PR/pr.odd: remove guard section
	around module for TEI.singleBase. It won't be needed.
	
	* Source/DS/ds.odd: backmatter and frontmatter no longer separate
	modules, subsumed into new module "textstructure" (was old "structure")

	* Source/ST/st.odd: we don't talk about "DTD fragments" any more,
	we try to use the more neutral word "modules".
	 - rename "structure" to "textstructure"
	 - start hacking transitional text about P3->P4
	 - remove discussion of independent modules
	 - remove modules "mixed" and "general"
	
2004-05-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* <xmleg>  to <egXML>, and ditto <eg>
	* no more publicID (construct from @n)
	* namespace for examples loses trailing /
	Yes, lots of XSL stylesheet changes as a result

2004-05-04  Lou <lou@janus.oucs.ox.ac.uk>
	Namechanges required by the integration of FS
	in TD:   string-> stringVal
	         default -> defaultVal
	in HD:   symbol -> metSym
	Did a global sweep through odds to change the first two, but only
	looked in HD and VE for the third.


2004-04-23  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* teiodds.xsl: change the way attributes are generate. instead of
	X.attributes pattern, insert for each attribute Y a reference to
	X.attributes.Y. Define this later to be pattern Y, definining
	attribute "name of Y", with reference to
	X.attributes.Y.content. This allows us to rename and override attributes.

2004-04-21  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* teiodds.xsl: if an <attDef> has a <valList type="closed">,
	always generate and refer to a x.attributes.y.values pattern,
	even of the datatype is not Code. This makes all closed values
	lists parameterizable.

2004-04-18  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* in order to get extensions working properly, a series of naming
	changes
	 a) <schema> and <module> join the tei.identifiable class, and so
	 use @ident instead of @name
	 b) <xmlName> is illegal, replaced by <altIdent>
	 c) drop @overrides and @inherits from moduleRef and set its
	 content model to be <empty/>
	 d) td.odd declared two modules called tagdocs, one should have
	 been tagdocs-desc. tsk tsk

	 e) corresponding changes in ODD-processing stylesheets

2004-04-09  Lou Burnard  <lou@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	Integrate msdescription module into existing ST/st.odd as quickest
	way of getting DTD validation. It now behaves just like any other
	additional tagset: keyword is "TEI.msdescription". Moved all ODDs
	into P5/Source/MS although they are still nominally under charge of
	workgroup. 
	

2004-03-28  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* implement the big revision following face to face META meeting,
	documented in Activities/META/mem03.xml

2004-03-16  Lou Burnard  <lou@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>
	    

          1. revised Source-Driver.xml so that distinct files had distinct
	       entity names (e.g. the 7 varieties of macro.component in different
	          bases became macro.xx.component where xx is the base name)

	  2. removed id from mixno.pat 

	  3. revised transformP5 script to just do copy, moving things to
		     newSource directory in the right place. Included
		     unholy hack to  deal with mixno
          4. Tried to validate regenerated newsource with following results

/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/prcomp.pat:1:119: error: ID "PRCOMP" has already been defined
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/prcomp.pat:1:119: error: first occurrence of ID "PRCOMP"
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/cbcomp.pat:1:119: error: ID "CBCOMP" has already been defined
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/cbcomp.pat:1:119: error: first occurrence of ID "CBCOMP"
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/clana.cla:1:70: error: ID "CLANA" has already been defined
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/clana.cla:1:70: error: first occurrence of ID "CLANA"
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/teigis.pat:1:119: error: ID "TEIGIS" has already been defined
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/teigis.pat:1:119: error: first occurrence of ID "TEIGIS"
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/teigis.pat:1:119: error: ID "TEIGIS" has already been defined
/home/lou/TEI/P5/newSource/ST/teigis.pat:1:119: error: first occurrence of ID "TEIGIS"


	5. TEIGIS is multiply defined because it's embedded by 3 different
          modules (ST, FD, SH). Change the latter two to use a moduleref,
          added new module to ST which defines the pattern/entity teigis2.ent.

        6. CLANA got missed during last nights pass through the driver. Fixed
           Source-driver.xml and st.odd.

        7. CBCOMP is referenced twice from st.odd, once for the general and
            once for the mixed base. Dunno what to do about that.

        8. PRCOMP is referenced twice from st.odd, once within a msection to
           define macro.component for the prose base; once at the end of the
           singlebase section as "the default". Comment out the second
           reference , since the rule is that you must supply a base.

2004-03-15  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* more restructuring:

	1. adList target=FOO  -> adList key=tei.foo
	2. tagDesc target=FOO  -> tagDesc key=tei.foo
	3. all datatypes  which are pointers to standard XSD datatypes
	changed to direct <rng:data>
	
	* many many changes to XSLT to cope with classse changes
	
2004-03-11  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* restructure ODDs to remove use of IDs where possible:
	
	  1. change <datatype target="datatype.foo"> to
	      <datatype><rng:ref name="datatype.foo"/></datatype>
	  2. change <classes names="A B C"> to
	      <classes>
	         <memberOf key="tei.a"/>
	          etc
	      </classes>
	  3. change entity names in Source-driver to be the ident, not the ID

2004-03-08  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* rearrange output structure so that everything is in
	subdirectories named after the id of the relevant <div1>. this
	breaks up the monolithic set of tag files into their modules

	* throw away all comments except those that seem related to <eg>
	or <xmleg>

2004-03-01  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* the big naming change.
	   class.FOO              --> tei.FOO
	   attributes.class.FOO   --> tei.FOO.attributes
	   content.FOO            --> FOO.content
	   attributes.FOO         --> FOO.attributes
	   values.class.FOO.BAR   --> tei.FOO.attributes.BAR.values

	 with the result that all public patterns start with "tei.",
	 and go from general->specific consistently. 

	 This affects lots of XSL files, moTags/* files, scripts

2004-02-29  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/p2st*: move TEI.2 and teiCorpus to core, to leave
	            "tei" module free of any definitions
	
	* relaxGen.xsl: put initial declarations into core;
	             leave "tei" as the start and some module loading

	* dtdGen.xsl: fix module processing with change from @file to @name

2004-02-27  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* revise the way we do extensions in ODDs
	   - <schema> and <module> both have "name" attribute instead of
	   "file"
	   - moduleRef can refer to a module by any of
	     * URL
	     * target attribute to ID
	     * body of the element refers to a @name of a <module>
	   - moduleRef has an override attribute which points to a <chunk>
	   containing tagdocs which override this module
	   - <schema> can have <chunkRef> children which performs
	   direct definition of tags (instead of via module)
	   - <classes> have <classRef> children instead of <class>
	   - kill <tagRename>
	   - many changes to XSL to make all this work
	   - <chunk> can occur anywhere, and has no direct effect on schema generation

2004-02-23  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/catref.tag: "scheme" attribute had type "req" instead of
	"opt". changed.

	* allow for writing TEI extensions in odds
	     - add <schema> element like <module>
	     - allow for "url" attribute of <moduleRef>
	     - add <tagRename> element
	     - allow <moduleRef> to have children (ie <tagDoc>s)
	     - support <class> children of <classes> instead of "names"
	     attribute
	
	 fix relaxGen.xsl accordingly
	

2004-01-26  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* cleanup.xsl: if <dataDesc> has something other than guff in it,
	add that to the <remarks> as a first <p rend="dataDesc">

	* prep5top5.xsl: kill all comments in ODDs. preserve them in old
	P4 instead...

	* moTags/tei2.tag: changed "teiversion" to "version"
	
	* (several files): changed <xmleg> to <xmlEg> for camel-case reasons

2004-01-22  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* relaxGen.xsl: redo public attribute class stubs; fix
	nomorechoices.xsl to not put <choice> around singleton <empty>

	* P4/placpart.cla (type): remove <attList>, as this is a model
	type, and so cannot have attributes

2004-01-19  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* odd2shared.xsl: suppress all but first occurence of each
	<patternDoc> to avoid the moras of mixed bases and so on.

	* change default for classes from <empty/> to <notAllowed/>
	in order to make auto DTD generation work.

2004-01-18  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* P4/paragraph.cla: new class for elements which
	just need <p> in the content model. viz
	<avail>, <correctn>, <equipmen>, <hyphen>, <interptn>, <normalzn>,
	<projdesc>, <quotn>, <sampdecl>, <segmentn>, <stdvals>


	* P4/categorize.cla: new class for elements which can appear
	inside <catDesc>. Affected element: <textDesc>. Needed because the
	latter does not appear until corpora is loaded.

	* P4/segment.cla: new class for segmenting elements 
	called "segment". Members so far: <ab> and <seg>. Affects
	content models of <m>, <sp>, <w>. Needed because these latter
	are in the core, but ab and seg only appear in linking.

2004-01-09  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/profile.cla: add new class for elements allowed in
	  <profileDesc>;  Affected tags: handList handShift langUsage particDesc
	  settingDesc textClass

	* P4/encoding.cla: add new class for elements allowed in
	<encodingDesc>. Affected tags: projectDesc samplingDecl
	editorialDecl tagsDecl refsDecl classDecl metDecl fsdDecl
	variantEncoding

	* P4/header.cla: add new class for elements allowed in <teiHeader>.
	Affected tags: encodingDesc profileDesc

2003-12-08  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/p2te.odd: completely kill the terminology chapter and
	associated elements and classes: admin.tag
	clterm.cl compterm.cla descrip.tag dftdict.cla ofig.tag othform.tag
	termentf.tag termentn.tag termincl.cla termmisc.cla

	* prep5top5.xsl: <claDecl> is replaced by inline <classDoc> (as
	entity) unless it is the second or subsequent
	definition. Reference chapters are given as body a <divGen> to
	generate the reference lists.

	* P4/p2stec.odd (nouns): sorry, but i hate dummy.dtd. Put in examples by
	hand and stop being clever.

	* P4/p2ditp.odd (dictionaries): sorry, guys, don't declare NOTE
	twice, please.

	* P4/p2stec.odd (nouns): sorry, dummy file cannot hold duplicates
	of existing things, it makes a mess.

	* prep5top5.xsl: rewrite whole document, replacing each
	<tagDecl> and <patternDecl> with corresponding <tagDoc> and
	<patternDoc> (as entities). remove tagDecl and patternDecl from system.

2003-11-26  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* odd2shared.xsl: if an attribute has a datatype of "Code", the
	value will be a pattern called "values.GI.ATTNAME", which is
	initially defined as "text". This can be overridden in a wrapper schema.

	* added datatypes for Certainty, Key and Codes; changed 60-70
	attributes to use them. they all expand to "CDATA" at present

2003-11-25  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* relaxGen.xsl: do not include "general" in main tei.rng;
	this means that alll wrapper schemas must include tei.rng and
	general.rng

	* listBibl.tag: in place of "trailer", use "divbot" class, to
	avoid dependency

	* add class.teiText and class.teiHeader, and change content model
	of TEI accordingly.

2003-11-24  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* Makefile (dtds): manually change (%schemapattern;)+ to
	schemapattern in tagdocs.dtd, as ANY cannot be qualified

	* P4/dieg.tag: changed name of this <eg> to <dicteg>, to avoid
	overlap. TO BE SORTED OUT!

	* rename elementContent to schemaContent, and use it in patternDoc
	as well as tagDoc. lots of resulting changes in XSLT scripts.

	* add pattern for "schemapattern"; this defaults to ANY, but
	p5odds.xsl redefines it as "anything from RelaxNG"

2003-11-22  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* relaxGen.xsl: when creating output modules, do not produce those
	with type "decls"; instead, include the contents of that module at
	the front of the module with the corresponding name with "-decl"
	stripped off.

	* relaxGen.xsl:  Put a fixed list of overrides of special defines

	* relaxGen.xsl/oddtransform.xsl: do not construct class contents
	at time of first definition, but extend the class at the relevant
	point when the module is loaded.
	
	* P4/p2stec.odd (file): add ODDPHR and ODDREF to low-level classes

	* P4/prxml.ent: make TEI.XML "INCLUDE" by default, not "IGNORE"

2003-11-20  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/figure.tag: added url, width, height, scale attributes

	* P4/xpointer.cla: added url attribute
	
	* P5/moTags: clean up and add tag/class docs until they match what
	is actually found in P5.

	* Renamed peRef to moduleRef _passim_. added target attribute
	pointing to id of <module>

	* Removed all old <entDoc> elements which describe modules, and
	moved the <publicID> into the <module>. This means that <module>
	is the only place which references a filename. 

	* Wholesale renaming of file references to remove the "tei2xxx" pattern
	in favour of real names. 

2003-11-10  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* Rename some patterns in P4/*:
	       component -> macro.component
	       component.plus -> macro.componentPlus
	       component.seq -> macro.componentSeq
	       paraContent -> macro.paraContent
	       phrase.seq -> macro.phraseSeq
	       phrase -> macro.phrasegroup
	       seq -> macro.seq
	       specialPara -> macro.specialPara
	
	* use <module> in place of <chunk file=>

2003-11-09  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* insertcontentmodels.xsl: get rid of @contin in dtdFrag
	(for each dtdFrag, find people who have it as @contin, and make a
	dtdRef to them)
	
	Change tagDecl, classDecl, patternDecl etc to have normal @target
	attribute instead of classDoc, tagDoc, patternDoc
	
	* clean.xsl etc: rename "a." to "attributes.", and insert "class."
	in front of _all_ classes; so "a.global" is now
	"attributes.class.global" 
	
	* relaxGen.xsl: zap whole concept of x.***** in schemas

2003-11-07  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* odd2html.xsl: turn each fragment of RNG into compact syntax
	using RngToRnc XSLT instead of external trang processor; this
	allows <ref> elements to be made into hyperlinks.

2003-11-05  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* insertcontentmodel.xsl: take each <eg> and put the contents
	into an <xmleg> element if it looks like being well-formed.
	<xmleg> and contents are in namespace
	http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples

	* odd2html.xsl: allow for xmleg, maybe correctly

	* P4/* clean up some illformed <eg> contents, in preparation
	for making them be proper XML in their own namespace.
	
	* change <gloss> for file patterns.

2003-11-04  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* (Lou) created or found tagdocs for extra or new ODD elements
	* Makefile and odd2html.xsl (etc) fixed to be able to make fascicules

2003-11-02  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* get rid of <part> in classDoc.
	 
	* major rename: "m." to "class." passim, and embed it in <ident>

2003-10-28  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* p2refs.odd, oddFiles.dtd: zap entName, tdeg; add patterndoc;

	* p2refs.odd, oddFiles.dtd, p2wd.odd: kill all of WSD
	which means all the following files are dead:
	basewsd.tag
	directn.tag
	exceptns.tag
	script.tag
	teiwsd.tag
	wsdccs.tag
	wsdchar.tag
	wsdchars.tag
	wsddesc.tag
	wsdents.tag
	wsdfig.tag
	wsdform.tag
	wsdglob.cla
	wsdlang.tag
	wsdnote.tag
	wsdxfig.tag

	* P4/p2td.odd: took out top-level material which makes it a
	separate DTD

2003-10-19  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* most of the xsl files affected, and some P4 sources.
	 Name changing (see MEW05):
	 <dataDesc> demoted to a comment; should be scanned
	 and interesting parts put into <remarks>
	 change <gi>, <attName>, <entName>, <class> to <ident>
	 change <name> to <gloss> in <entDoc>, <classDoc>, <tagDoc>, <attDef>
	 wrapper of <elementContent> around content RelaxNG in tagdocs and
	      classdocs
	 change name of <dtdRef> and <dtdFrag> to <chunkRef> and <chunk>
         disallow <rs> as alternative to <gloss> in tagdocs
         zap empty <attList> from <classDoc>
         zap empty <classes> from <classDoc>
         <entDoc>, <entDecl> - renamed to <patternDoc>, <patternDecl>
	 In <valList>, change from <val><desc> pair to <valitem>, containing
         a standard <ident>, <equiv>, <glosss>

2003-10-10  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/*: change names of entities which load files so that they do
          not conflict with element names. 

	* relaxGen.xsl: model classes are populated initially only by
          other model classes, not by any elements. Make some evil
          elements have default empty models so that they can be used anywhere

	* relaxGen.xsl: move to organic scheme whereby each element
          interleaves itself into its model class. no more INCLUDE/IGNORE,
	  we just include the schema file if we want to use it. Use proper
	  filenames.
	
	* p5odds.rng, tei-oucs.rng, test0.rng: make conform to organic schema 

2003-10-09  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* P4/*: change all typeXXXXX to datatype.Xxxxxx

2003-10-08  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* rework odd2html and all associated stylesheets to
	generate HTML from namespaced TEI

2003-07-13  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* add a new part to gram.patch, which cleans up the multiple
	component definitions. I don't know how to do this properly at
	present. 
	* remove TEI.* guard from inner <choice> elements

2003-07-06  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* rework dtdGen.xsl, relaxGen.xsl, odd2shared.xsl to put all TEI
	elements in TEI namespace. add necessary things in Makefile
	to clean up rng/dtd files
	
	* redo all example XML and RNG wrappers to use TEI namespace

	* get rid of <string> elements containing IGNORE, INCLUDE and 
	CDATA in favour of rng elements (in insertcontents.xsl)

	* add new type for entDoc "epe" for when it is providing
	attributes

	* clean up dtdGen until it works again. now RNG and DTD generation
	both work.
	
2003-05-21  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* redo the file names. where before we had file=foo and
	file=foo.ent, the latter is now file=fooent, so that we have a
	single rule about file suffixes and lookups

2003-05-19  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* redo the <string> elements which have public IDs in, replace
	with <publicID file="...">...</publicID>
	   

2003-05-18  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* relaxGen.xsl: find default for attributes, work to new schema
	* p5odds.rng: adapted to new markup
	* typecleanup.xsl:  content of attDef is valid rng:attribute
   	  (possibly surrounded by rng:optional). zapped <datatype>,
	  but preserve attList/attDef. Leave <default> in TEI
	  namespace, as putting it in RNG makes the validation fall over.
	* P4/* rename TEI.2 to TEI
	       rename teiCorpus.2 to teiCorpus
	       zapped parents/children/attldecl from TD
