# 	$PROGRAM_NAME [--patternprefix=STRING]
# 
# where:
# * --patternprefix=STRING provides an optional prefix string that is
# *                        prefixed to all patterns in the schema.
# *                        I.e., This should be the same string that
# *                        has just been handed to roma.sh.
# * input, always from STDIN, should be a Roma-generated RelaxNG
#          compact syntax file.
# * output, always to STDOUT, will be the same file with much prettier
#           use of whitespace.
# 
# Chnage log (CVS-maintained) near the bottom of this file (I hope :-).
