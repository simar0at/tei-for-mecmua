1. The "Filename" field on the customization page seems to accept
   most anything typed there. Entering strings that have slashes,
   back slashes colons, or whitespace are all likely to cause
   problems on some system or other for the filename. But moreover,
   this value is the value of ident= of <schemaSpec>, and therefore
   has to be a data.name, i.e. an xsd:Name. It should be checked
   immediately when the user clicks "Submit" on the "Customize your
   customization" page. (Similarly the new "Prefix for TEI pattern
   names in schema" field.)

2. On the page for editing attributes (also used for adding a new
   attribute, and thus I gather named "Add some attributes") the
   "List of values" field has similar problems. It permits anything
   to be entered, the result of which may not be at all what the user
   intended, and often results in an invalid ODD file. More on the
   datatype problems here in a subsequent mailpiece. But for now, I
   think Roma should do something a bit more intelligent. The
   error-checking should occur up front. My first-cut suggestion is: 
   * a value stuck onto ident= of <valItem> and thus into the
     schema should be an xsd:Name.
   * Roma should either
     - parse the string the user sticks in on any non-xsd:Name
       characters (I.e., "red, white,and blue are the colors/of
       the Union,Jack!" should result in
          red     white  and
          blue    are    the
          colors  of     the
          Union   Jack
       with no errors.)
     - expect a whitespace-separated string of xsd:Names, and
       complain if there's anything else (I.e. the above string
       gives an error, as does "This is 4you"; whereas "This is
       for you" results in
          This  is  for  you
       with no errors.)

3. (Non-Roma.) The content model for <div> is seriously screwed up.
   (Besides the issues raised on TEI-L, it permits a <p> before a
   <head>.) I will not have a chance to look at it today, but I hope
   to tomorrow.

4. A *lot* more on-screen documentation is in order. (E.g., the
   existence of both the the drop-down menu and the type-in box in
   the "Contents" field of the "Add Element" page seems quite
   confusing. I can perhaps provide more examples later, but gotta go
   now.)

5. I doubt you can fix it, but everyone complains about losing stuff
   when after having slected elements on the "Change module" page,
   and clicking something other than "Submit Query".
