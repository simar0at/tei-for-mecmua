    <body><p>OVID</p><div type="div1"><head>TO<lb/> Mrs. ARABELLA FERMOUR.</head><p><lb/>It will be in vain to<lb/> deny that I have some<lb/> value for this piece,<lb/> since I dedicate it to<lb/> you. Yet you may<lb/> bear me witness, it<lb/> was intended only to divert a few young <lb/> Ladies, who have good sense and good<lb/> Humour enough, to laugh not only at<lb/> their sex's little unguarded Follies, but at<lb/> their own. But as it was communicated<lb/> with the Air of a Secret, it soon found its<lb/> Way into the World. An imperfect<lb/> Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller,<lb/> You had the Good-Nature for my Sake<lb/> to consent to the publication of one<lb/> more correct: This I was forc'd to be-<lb/> fore I had executed half my Design, for<lb/> the <emph>Machinery</emph> was entirely wanting to<lb/> compleat it.</p><p><lb/>The <emph>Machinery</emph> Madam, is a Term<lb/> invented by the Critiks, to signify that <lb/> Part which the Deities, Angels, or D-<lb/> mons, are made to act in a poem: For<lb/> the ancient Poets are in one respect like<lb/> many modern Ladies; Let an Action be<lb/> never so trivial in it self, they always<lb/> make it appear of the utmost Impor-<lb/> tance. These Machines I determin'd to <lb/> raise on a very new and odd Foundation,<lb/> the <emph>Rosicrucian</emph> Doctrine of Spirits.</p><p><lb/>I know how disagreeable it is to make<lb/> use of hard Words before a Lady; but<lb/> 'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to<lb/> have his Works understood, and particu-<lb/> larly by your Sex, that You must give me <lb/> leave to explain two or three difficult<lb/> Terms.</p><p><lb/>The <emph>Rosicrucians</emph> are the People I must<lb/> bring You acquainted with. The best<lb/> Account I know of them is in the French<lb/> Book call'd Le Comte de Gabalis, which<lb/> both in its Title and Size is so like a<lb/><emph>Novel,</emph> that many of the fair Sex have<lb/> read it for one by Mistake. According<lb/> to these Gentlemen, the four Elements<lb/> are inhabited by Spirits, which they call<lb/><emph>Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,</emph> and <emph>Salamanders.</emph><lb/> The <emph>Gnomes,</emph> or Daemons of Earth, de-<lb/> light in Mischief; but the <emph>Sylphs,</emph> whose<lb/> Habitation is Air, are the best-condition'd<lb/> Creatures imaginable. For the say, any<lb/> Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Fa-<lb/> miliarities with these gentle Spirits, upon<lb/> a Condition very easie to all true <emph>Adepts,</emph><lb/> an involate Preservation of Chastity.</p><p><lb/>As to the following Canto's, all the<lb/> Passages of them are as Fabulous, as the<lb/> Vision at the beginning, or the Transfor- <lb/> mation at the End; (except the Loss of<lb/> your Hair, which I always mane with Re-<lb/> verence.) The Human Persons are as Ficti-<lb/> tious as the Airy ones; and the Character<lb/> of <emph>Belinda,</emph>as it is now manag'd, resem-<lb/> bles You in nothing but in Beauty.</p><p><lb/>If this Poem had as many Graces as<lb/> there are in Your Person, or in Your Mind,<lb/> yet I could never hope it should pass thro'<lb/> the World half so Uncensured as You have<lb/> done. But let its Fortune be what it will,<lb/> mine is happy enough, to have given me<lb/> this Occasion of assuring You that I am.<lb/> with the truest Esteem,</p><p>A. POPE. </p><lg>
        <l>WHAT dire Offence from am'rous Causes springs, </l>

      </lg><lg>
        <l>Fairest of Mortals, thou distinguish'd Care </l>
        <l>Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air! </l>
        <l>If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant Thought, </l>
        <l>Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught, </l>
        <l>Of airy Elves by Moonlight Shadows seen, </l>
        <l>The silver Token, and the circled Green, </l>
        <l>Or Virgins visited by Angel-Pow'rs, </l>
        <l>With Golden Crowns and Wreaths of heav'nly Flowers, </l>
        <l>Hear and believe! thy own Importance know, </l>
        <l>Nor bound thy narrow Views to Things below. </l>
        <l>Some secret Truths from Learned Pride conceal'd, </l>
        <l>To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd: </l>
        <l>What tho' no Credit doubting Wits may give? </l>
        <l>The Fair and Innocent shall still believe. </l>
        <l>Know then, unnumbered Spirits round thee fly, </l>
        <l>The light </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Militia</emph>
        </l>
        <l> of the lower Sky; </l>
        <l>These, tho' unseen, are ever on the Wing, </l>
        <l>Hang o'er the </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Box</emph>
        </l>
        <l>, and hover round the </l>

          <emph>Ring</emph>

          <emph>Two Pages</emph>

        <l>As now your own, our Beings were of old, </l>
        <l>And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous Mold; </l>
        <l>Thence, by a soft Transition, we repair </l>
        <l>From earthly Vehicles to these of Air. </l>
        <l>Think not, when Woman's transient Breath is fled, </l>
        <l>That all her Vanities at once are dead: </l>
        <l>Succeeding Vanities she still regards, </l>
        <l>And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the Cards. </l>
        <l>Her Joy in gilded Chariots, when alive, </l>
        <l>And Love of </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Ombre</emph>
        </l>
        <l>, after Death survive. </l>
        <l>For when the Fair in all their Pride expire, </l>
        <l>To their first Elements the Souls retire: </l>
        <l>The Sprights of fiery Termagants in Flame </l>
        <l>Mount up, and take a </l>

        <l>Soft yielding Minds to Water glide away, </l>

          <emph>Nymphs</emph>
        </l>
        <l>, their Elemental Tea. </l>

          <emph>Sylphs</emph>

        </l>

        <l>For Spirits, freed from mortal Laws, with ease </l>
        <l>Assume what Sexes and what Shapes they please. </l>
        <l>What guards the Purity of melting Maids, </l>
        <l>In Courtly Balls, and Midnight Masquerades, </l>
        <l>Safe from the treach'rous Friend, and daring Spark, </l>
        <l>The Glance by Day, the Whisper in the Dark; </l>
        <l>When kind Occasion prompts their warm Desires, </l>
        <l>When Musick softens, and when Dancing fires? </l>
        <l>'Tis but their </l>

          <emph>Honour</emph>
        </l>
        <l> is the Word with Men below.</l>
      </lg><lg>
        <l>Some Nymphs there are, too conscious of their Face, </l>
        <l>For Life predestin'd to the </l>

          <emph>Gnomes</emph>
        </l>
        <l> Embrace. </l>
        <l>Who swell their Prospects and exalt their Pride, </l>
        <l>When Offers are disdain'd, and Love deny'd. </l>
        <l>Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant Brain; </l>
        <l>While Peers and Dukes, and all their sweeping Train, </l>
        <l>And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear, </l>
        <l>And in soft Sounds, </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Your Grace</emph>
        </l>
        <l> salutes their Ear. </l>
        <l>'Tis these that early taint the Female Soul, </l>

        <l>Thro' all the giddy Circle they pursue, </l>
        <l>And old Impertinence expel by new. </l>
        <l>What tender Maid but must a Victim fall </l>
        <l>To one Man's Treat, but for another's Ball? </l>
        <l>When </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Florio</emph>
        </l>
        <l> speaks, what Virgin could withstand, </l>

        <l>With varying Vanities, from ev'ry Part, </l>
        <l>They shift the moving Toyshop of their Heart; </l>
        <l>Where Wigs with Wigs, with Sword-knots Sword-knots strive, </l>
        <l>Beaus banish Beaus, and Coaches Coaches drive. </l>
        <l>This erring Mortals Levity may call, </l>

        <l>This to disclose is all thy Guardian can. </l>

        <l>On her white Breast a sparkling </l>
        <l>
          <emph>Cross</emph>
        </l>

        <l>Her lively Looks a sprightly Mind disclose, </l>
        <l>Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those: </l>
        <l>Favours to none, to all she Smiles extends, </l>
        <l>Oft she rejects, but never once offends. </l>
        <l>Bright as the Sun, her Eyes the Gazers strike, </l>
        <l>And, like the sun, they shine on all alike. </l>
        <l>Yet graceful Ease, and Sweetness void of Pride, </l>

        <l>This Nymph, to the Destruction of Mankind, </l>

        <l>With shining Ringlets her smooth Iv'ry Neck. </l>
        <l>Love in these Labyrinths his Slaves detains, </l>
        <l>And mighty Hearts are held in slender Chains. </l>
        <l>With hairy Sprindges we the Birds betray, </l>
        <l>Slight Lines of Hair surprize the Finny Prey, </l>
        <l>Fair Tresses Man's Imperial Race insnare, </l>

        <l>This just behind </l>

        <l>And thrice they twitch'd the Diamond in her Ear, </l>
        <l>Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the Foe drew near. </l>

        <l>An Earthly Lover lurking at her Heart. </l>
        <l>Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his Pow'r expir'd, </l>
