Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</p></div><div type="div1"><head>Some nonsense</head><p>Some simple markup</p><p>The hi element is used for various forms of highlighting: e.g. <hi>bold</hi>, <emph>italic</emph> and <hi rend="sc">small caps</hi>.</p><p>The emph element is used for linguistic emph<emph>asis</emph>. highlighting (soCalled) nor with shouting (mentioned), transmogrification, (a technical term), for which the gloss tag might be used to supply a technical definition).</p><p>Now for some links!
