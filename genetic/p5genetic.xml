<note rend="it">insert the following para following 22nd para in
#PHFAX</note>
<p>If, as is more often the case, a transcription of the zone identified
in this way is to be included in the encoded document, this may be
done in two ways. If the transcription is regarded as a text in its
own right, organized and structured independently of its physical
realization in the document or documents represented by the facsimile,
then the recommended practice is to use the traditional <gi>text</gi>
element, provided as a sibling of the <gi>facsimile</gi> element. This
approach is illustrated in section <ptr target="#PH-bov"/>
below. Alternatively, if the transcription is intended to do no more
than represent the physicality of the document itself, it may be
preferable to use the elements <gi>patch</gi>, <gi>line</gi>, and
<gi>ab</gi>, embedded within the <gi>zone</gi> element, as further
described in section <ptr target="#PHZLAB"/> below.</p>

<div><head>Combining transcription with facsimile</head>

<p>A digitized source document may contain nothing more than page images and a
small amount of metadata. It may also contain an encoded transcription
of the pages represented, which may either be <q>embedded</q> within
the <gi>facsimile</gi> structure, or given in parallel to it. </p>

<div><head>Parallel transcription</head>
<note rend="it">Remainder of section PHFAX (the Bovelles example) goes here</note>
</div>

<div xml:id="PHZLAB"><head>Embedded transcription</head>
<p>An <term>embedded transcription</term> is one in which words
and other written traces are encoded as subcomponents of elements
representing the physical surfaces carrying them rather than
independently of them. </p>
<p>The following elements are available for this purpose:
<specList>
<specDesc key="surface"/>
<specDesc key="zone"/>
<specDesc key="patch" atts="binder height width flipping"/>
<specDesc key="line" atts="type" />
<specDesc key="ab" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="seg" atts="type"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>The elements <gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi> were introduced
above, in section <ptr target="#PHFAX"/>. The element <gi>patch</gi>
is useful in cases where the written surfaces constituting a document
are not homogeneous. In the following example, taken from the Walt
Whitman archive, two pieces of newsprint have been glued to a piece of
blue paper on which a poem is being drafted: 

<figure>
            <graphic url="examples/whitman01.jpg" width="400px"/>
            <head rend="it">Image from
               http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/duk.00258.001.jpg</head>
         </figure>  
The two pieces of newsprint might perhaps be regarded as special kinds
of zone, but they are effectively new surfaces, since they might
contain additional written zones themselves (such as the numbers in
this case). We therefore propose a distinct element, <gi>patch</gi>,
which can appear within a <gi>surface</gi>, and behaves effectively
like one, except that it contains specialized attributes to provide
additional information.</p>

<p>Most writing is linear, in the sense that it is composed of
discrete tokens organized physically into groups, typically organized
in a sequence corresponding with the way they are intended to be
read. Depending on the directionality of the writing system used,
this might be any combination of top-down and left to right, or vice
versa. It thus seems convenient to introduce a unit <gi>line</gi> to
hold a complete group of such tokens. Where, however, the lineation is
not considered useful or significant, groups of tokens may be
indicated using the neutral <gi>ab</gi> (anonymous block) element or
<gi>seg</gi> elements described in section <ptr
target="#SASE"/>. 
</p>

<!-- QUERY some usage notes for choosing between seg and ab would be useful
-->

<p>Using these elements, the Whitman draft above might be encoded as
follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<surface>
   <zone>
      <line>Poem</line>
      <line>As in Visions of — at</line>
      <line>night —</line>
      <line>All sorts of fancies running through</line>
      <line>the head</line>
   </zone>
   <patch type="newsprint" binder="glue"
			       height="40" width="90"> 
			  <ab>Spring has
      just set in here, and the weather.... a
			   steamer </ab>
         <metaMark function="sequence">2</metaMark>
   </patch>
   <patch type="newsprint" binder="glue"
			       height="35" width="90"> 
			  <ab>"The shores on either side of the Sound are... The In-       </ab>   
			   <metaMark function="sequence">3</metaMark>
   </patch>
</surface>
</egXML> 
</p>

<p>The <gi>metaMark</gi> element used in this example is further
discussed below (<ptr target="#PH-meta"/>)</p>

<p>Note that in this example we have not included any <gi>graphic</gi> element
corresponding with the <gi>zone</gi> or <gi>surface</gi> elements 
identified in the transcription. The encoder may choose to combine
graphics with the transcription at whatever level is considered
effective, or not at all. Equally, the encoder may choose to provide
only graphics without transcription, or with a structured
(non-embedded) transcription, or any combination of the three. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div xml:id="PH-summ"><head>Transcribing the process</head>

<note rend="ital">Insert the following into the first para of #PHST
("Scope of Transcriptions"), following the second sentence. Some
readjustment of the list in that para will also be needed. </note>

<p>Such elements may also be used for digital
transcriptions in which the object is not to represent a finished
text, but rather to represent the creative process, as evidenced by
different <q>layers</q> or <q>traces</q> of writing in one or more
documents. Transcriptions of this kind are closely focussed on the physical
appearance of specific documents, needing to distinguish the traces of
different writing activities on them, such as additions,
and deletions but also other indications of how the writing is to be
read, such as indications of transposition, re-affirmation of writing
which has been deleted, and so on.  Such distinctions are considered of
particular importance when dealing with authorial manuscripts, but are
also relevant in the case of historical sources such as charters or
other legal documents.</p>

<p>To encode such transcriptions, we propose a simple model in which
writing traces are marked with an appropriate tag such as
<gi>mod</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, etc. to indicate their function in the
document, as described in the remainder of this chapter. Each such
element can be assigned to one or more editorially-defined
modification groups, termed a <term>layer</term>, by means of a global
<att>layer</att> attribute, which references a definition for the
layer concerned, typically provided within the TEI Header
<gi>creation</gi> element; see further <ptr target="#PH-layers"/>. The
transcription itself is provided within a <gi>facsimile</gi> element,

<!-- QUERY how about transcript as elephant name ?-->

using the elements <gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi> described in
section <ptr target="#PHFAX"/>. Within a <gi>zone</gi>, the
transcription may be organized in terms of lines of writing, using the
<gi>line</gi> element, or in terms of blocks of writing, using the
<gi>ab</gi> (anonymous block) element, or as a combination of the two;
see further <ptr target="#PH-ZLAB"/>.
</p>
</div>


<div xml:id="alterations">
<note rend="ital">Insert this section into PHST, probably at the end.</note>
   <head>Marking up the writing process</head>
   <p>Modifications of various kinds (correction, addition, deletion,
   etc.) are frequently found within a single document, and may also
   be inferred when different documents are compared, although it may be
   an open question as to whether inter-document discrepancies at the
   dossier level should be regarded in the same way as intra-document
   alterations. When two witnesses are collated, we may observe that a
   word present in one is missing from the other: this does not necessarily
   imply that the word was added to the first witness, nor that it
   was deleted from the other. 
   </p>

<p>In this section we discuss a number of elements which may be used to 
record traces of the writing process within a document. 
</p>


<div><head>Generic modification</head>

<specList>
<specDesc key="mod" atts="rend type spanTo"/>
</specList>


   <p>Most of these elements imply a certain level of semantic
   interpretation. For instance, using the <gi>add</gi> element to
   encode interlinear insertions implies a decision that the
   interlinear text has been deliberately inserted rather than simply
   written between the lines.  Where it is felt desirable to keep the
   recording of <soCalled>what is on the page</soCalled> entirely
   separate from <soCalled>what is the editor’s
   interpretation</soCalled>, the generic <gi>mod</gi> element may be
   preferred. This element simply indicates any kind of modification
   that has been identified in the document, without prejudice as to
   its function. Occurrences of the <gi>mod</gi> element may be
   categorised by means of their <att>type</att> attribute, and visual
   aspects of their appearance can be described by means of the
   <att>rend</att> attribute, but they provide no further
   interpretation of the function or intention of the passage so
   marked up. The <att>spanTo</att> may be used to indicate the end of
   a modified passage if this extends across the boundaries of some
   other XML element, for example from the middle of one line tagged
   as a <gi>line</gi> to the middle of another <gi>line</gi> some
   distance further on in the document. </p>
<egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<ab>words words words <mod rend="wavy-underlining" spanTo="#enduw"/>words with wavy underline</ab>
<ab>wavy underlining finishes here<anchor xml:id="enduw"/> more words    </ab>
</egXML>
<!-- QUERY real example needed -->
<p>The distinction between an example such as that above and the simple
use of <gi>hi</gi> to mark the visual salience of the underlining
(apart from  the use of the <att>spanTo</att> attribute) is that
<gi>hi</gi> does not imply that the visual effect being recorded is
understood to represent some kind of modification. 
</p></div>

   <div xml:id="PH-meta"><head>Metamarks</head>

<p>By <term>metamark</term> we mean marks such as numbers, arrows,
crosses, or other symbols introduced by the writer into a document
expressly for the purpose of indicating how the text is to be
read. Such marks thus constitute a kind of markup of the document,
rather than forming part of the text.
 <specList>         
<specDesc key="metaMark" atts="function target spanTo"/></specList>
</p>      

<p>Unlike marginal notes or other additions to the text, meta-marks
are used by the writer to indicate a deliberate alteration of the writing itself,
such as <q>move this passage over there</q>. An addition or annotation
by contrast would typically concern some property of the passage other
than its intended location or status within the text flow.  A metamark
may however contain text, or some other graphic which the encoder
wishes to preserve, or it may simply consist of arrows, dots, lines
etc. which the encoder simply describes.</p>

<!-- QUERY should it contain <desc> as a child? -->

<p>The <gi>metaMark</gi> element carries a <att>function</att>
attribute which specifies the function of the meta-mark, using values
such as <val>reorder flag delete insert used</val>. The passage to
which the metamark applies may be indicated in either of two ways: the
<att>target</att> attribute may be used to point to the element or
elements containing the passage concerned, or the <att>spanTo</att>
element may be used to point to a position in the document at which
the passage concerned finishes. In the latter case, the
<gi>metaMark</gi> itself must be supplied at the position in the
document where the passage concerned begins; in the former case it may
be supplied at any convenient point. Both attributes should not be
supplied. </p>
      
<p>The following example is taken from  an
15th century legal book from the city of Göttingen, containing
regulations of everyday life issued by the city council <figure>
<graphic url="examples/ka04_1v-dtl.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head><title>Kundige bok 2</title>, fol 1v. </head>
         </figure>
      </p>
<!-- QUERY : proper reference needed   -->
    
<p>In the second paragraph,  the word <mentioned
xml:lang="lat">lege</mentioned> ("read") was written in the left hand
margin, next to the sentence beginning <q>Ock en schullen
de bruwere...</q>. It is thought to
function as a metamark,  indicating that this sentence forms part of
the regulations. A further sentence was then added, while at some
later stage the text and also the metamark were deleted. We
might encode this as follows: <!-- ka04_1v-dtl.xml --><egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<delSpan target="#endDel" layer="#L3"/>
   <metaMark function="flag" target="#s1" layer="#L2">lege</metaMark>
   <ab xml:id="s1" layer="#L1">Ock en schullen de bruwere des hilgen dages nicht over
      <lb/>setten noch uppe den stillen fridach bruwen.</ab>
   <addSpan target="#endDel" layer="#L2"/>
      <ab>Noch nymande <lb/>over setten, se en sehin denne erst, dat uppe den
         bonen <lb/>neyn stro noch, huw noch flaß ligghe, by pine eyner
         halven <lb/>roden, deme bruwere so wol alse dem bruwheren to
         murende.</ab>
   <anchor xml:id="endDel"/>
         </egXML>
      </p>
<p>The <att>layer</att> attribute used here to indicate the sequencing
of these various interventions is discussed below, in section <ptr
target="#PH-layers"/>. The elements <gi>addSpan</gi> and
<gi>delSpan</gi> are discussed in section <ptr target="PH-xxx"/>. </p>
      
<p>The <gi>metaMark</gi> element may also be used to encode the
symbols etc. often found in marked-up proofs such as the following,
taken from the Walt Whitman archive:
         <figure>
<graphic url="examples/loc.00295.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head>http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/</head>
         </figure></p>
<p>In this example, the whole of what was originally the 14th section
has been marked for deletion, both by horizontal and vertical lines,
and by the metamarks resembling the <q>delta</q> deletion symbol to
left and right of the section. This might be encoded more economically
by using the normal <gi>del</gi> or <gi>delSpan</gi> element. However,
it may also be useful to distinguish cases like this from cases the
writer does not intend to suppress the content, but only to mark that
it has been transferred or reused. An appropriate value (such as
<val>used</val>) should be provided for the <att>function</att>
attribute in the latter case. 
</p>   
<p>The following page from the Walt Whitman archive has been crossed through to
indicate used material: <figure>
<graphic url="examples/whitman02.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head>Page from
   http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/20051105_0650.jpg</head>
         </figure> 
This page contains many internal deletions, but these should be
distinguished from the <soCalled>deletion</soCalled> signalled by the large
cross, which actually shows that the page has been transferred or re-used, not
deleted. </p>
<egXML

   </div>

<div><head>Fixation and clarification</head>

<p>A writer may sometimes rewrite material a second time without
significant change and in the same place. We consider this a distinct
activity from addition as usually defined because no new textual
material results; instead the status of existing material changes. We may
distinguish two variants of this: <term>fixation</term> where the
first version was a tentative draft which is subsequently fixed, for
example by inking it over; and <term>clarification</term>, where the
first version was badly written and has been rewritten for
clarity. The element <gi>retrace</gi> is provided for both cases; its
<att>cause</att> attribute may be used to distinguish them. 
<specList>
         <specDesc key="retrace" atts="cause"/>
      </specList>
</p>
      
<p>In this simple example, taken from the papers of Henrik Ibsen, the
writer wrote the word <mentioned>skuldren</mentioned> hastily, and
then returned to it to make the letter <mentioned>l</mentioned> larger
and clearer: <figure>
<graphic url="examples/skuldren.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head rend="it">Image from a ms of Peer Gynt, Collin 2869, 4°, I.1.1, the
   Royal Library of Copenhagen</head>
         </figure> We might transcribe this word as follows: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line>... Sku<retrace cause="unclear">l</retrace>dren </line>
         </egXML>
</p>

<p>A single rewrite may not be sufficient, and it may be that the
document becomes almost unreadable as a result of repeated
clarification. In the following example, we can distinguish at least
two attempts to write the letters <mentioned>er</mentioned> in the
word <mentioned>bægerklang</mentioned>: <figure>
<graphic url="examples/munch01.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head rend="it">Image from http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html </head>
</figure> We might encode this by nesting the <gi>retrace</gi> element as
         follows: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line>ved Bæg<retrace cause="unclear" layer="#stage2">
      <retrace cause="unclear" layer="#stage1">er</retrace>
   </retrace> ...</line>
         </egXML> The <att>layer</att> attribute used here is discussed further below
(<ptr target="#PH-layers"/>). </p>

<p>The <gi>retrace</gi> element is used only for cases where text has
been written multiple times. When metamarks and other markup-like strokes
are inked over with the same purpose as the fixation or
clarification of text passages, the <gi>redo</gi> element described in
the next section should be used in preference.
</p>   </div>

 <div xml:id="undo">
<head>Fixation, cancellation, and reinstatement of modifications</head>

<p>In a draft version of Goethe’s Faust, a passage was struck through
once in pencil during one revision and then again with ink during a
later revision, supposedly to fixate the deletion.
      <figure>
         <graphic url="examples/faust_redo.jpg"/>
         <head rend="it">Fixation of a deletion in Goethe’s Faust</head>
      </figure>
A writer may also indicate that an alteration is itself to be altered:
for example, a struck-through passage may be restored via a dotted
underlining, or the underlining of a passage may be deleted by a wavy
line.</p>

<p>The following elements are provided to represent these situations:
<specList>
<specDesc key="redo" atts="target cause spanTo"/>
<specDesc key="undo" atts="target cause spanTo"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>The <gi>redo</gi> element might be used to encode the Faust example above
as follows:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <line><redo xml:id="redo_3" hand="#g_t" target="#mod_1" cause="fix"
   /><mod xml:id="mod_1" rend="strikethrough" spanTo="#anchor_1"
   hand="#g_bl"/>Ihr hagren, triſten, krummgezog<mod rend="strikethrough"
   >nen</mod>ener Nacken</line>
         <line>Wenn ihr nur piepſet iſt die Welt ſchon matt.<anchor xml:id="anchor_1"
/></line>
      </egXML>

<!-- NOTE insert narrative explanation -->

      
<p>The element <gi>restore</gi> (<ptr target="#PH-wherever"/>) is
provided for the comparatively simple case where a simple deletion is
marked as having been subsequently cancelled. The <gi>undo</gi>
element discussed here is more widely applicable and may be used for
any kind of cancellation. It points to the element or elements which
are being cancelled. These components need not be contiguous, provided
that the cancellation is clearly a single act; each distinct act of
cancellation requires a distinct <gi>undo</gi> element, however. Either
of the attributes <att>target</att> or <gi>spanTo</gi> may be used to
indicate the passages concerned. </p>

      <p>Consider the following imaginary example : 
<figure>
      <graphic url="examples/undoing1.jpg" width="400px"/>
   </figure>
We hypothesize that the text has gone through three states or layers,
as follows:
<list type="ordered">
<item>This is just some sample text, we need a real example. </item>
<item>This is not a real example.</item>
<item>This is just some text, not a real example.</item>
         </list>
</p>
      
<p>This sequence of events might be encoded as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line>This is <del layer="#s2"  rend="overstrike"> 
<undo spanTo="#Xa" rend="dotted" layer="#s3"/>just some
<anchor xml:id="Xa"/> sample <undo spanTo="#Xb" rend="dotted" layer="#s3"/>text,
<anchor xml:id="Xb"/> we need</del>
<add layer="#s2">not</add>
a real example.</line> 
</egXML> 
using <att>spanTo</att> to delimit the parts of the deletion which
have been reverted at layer s2. </p>

<p>Alternatively, we might use the generic <gi>seg</gi> element within
the <gi>line</gi> to delimit the two sequences whose
deletion is being reverted, and then use the <gi>target</gi> attribute
on <gi>undo</gi> :

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line>This is <del layer="#s2"  rend="overstrike"> 
<seg xml:id="X-a">just some</seg>
sample <seg xml:id="X-b">text</seg>,
we need</del>
<add layer="#s2">not</add>
a real example.</line> 
<undo target="#X-a #X-b" rend="dotted" layer="#s3"/>
</egXML> 


<!-- NOTE maybe add a third example doing this with xpath to pick out
individual tokens. Or one from a real doc -->
</p>
   </div>
 
<div xml:id="transpo"><head>Transpositions</head>
      
<p>A <term>transposition</term> occurs when metamarks are found in a
document indicating that passages should be moved to a different
position. Typically this may be done  using
arrows, asterisks or numbers, or other means. By definition the result
of a transposition is not present in the document, and should not
therefore be encoded, if the intention is to record its actual
state. Instead, the following elements may be used to indicate the
intended reordering:
<specList>
<specDesc key="transposeGrp"/>
<specDesc key="transpose"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Consider for example, the
         following extract from an Ibsen manuscript <figure>
<graphic url="examples/ibsen01.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head>Extracted from
   <ref>http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html</ref></head>
         </figure>
The underlined numbers 1 and 2 here indicate that, although the word
<mentioned>bör</mentioned> precedes the word
<mentioned>hör</mentioned> in the text, the order of the two words
should be reversed. We may encode this as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line><seg xml:id="ib01">bör</seg><metaMark rend="underline"
      function="transposition" target="#ib1" place="above">2.</metaMark>
   og <seg xml:id="ib02">hör</seg><metaMark rend="underline"
      function="transposition" target="#ib02" place="above"
   >1.</metaMark></line>
<transposeGrp>
   <transpose>
      <ptr target="#ib02"/>
      <ptr target="#ib01"/>
   </transpose>
</transposeGrp>
         </egXML>
      </p>
      
<p>Note the use of the generic <gi>seg</gi> element to identify the
sections of text being transposed. When (as in the following example)
the whole of line is to be transposed, there is no need to delimit the
sections concerned: <figure>
<graphic url="examples/ibsen04.jpg" width="400px"/>
<head>Extracted from
   <ref>http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms3.html</ref></head>
         </figure>
         <!-- ibsen04.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<line xml:id="ib3"><metaMark function="transposition"
      place="margin-left">2.)</metaMark> thi da er du med Himmelen i
   Pagt; — </line>
<line xml:id="ib4">
   <metaMark function="transposition"
	     place="margin-left">1.)</metaMark>

<transposeGrp>
   <transpose>
      <ptr target="#ib4"/>
      <ptr target="#ib3"/>
   </transpose>
</transposeGrp>
         </egXML> 
When transposition is made, the whole element indicated is understood

In this example two alternative readings are provided, but no
preference is indicated. While the author apparently
first composed the line <q>Alone before his native river -</q>, at some
later point, he entertained the possibility of using the word <mentioned>beside</mentioned>
instead of <mentioned>before</mentioned>. The manuscript supplies no
indication of which word Moore favours at this point, although in
fact, in the first printed
edition of <title>Lalla Rookh</title> the word
<mentioned>beside</mentioned> was chosen. </p>
<p>The element <gi>alt</gi> provided by the <ident
type="module">linking</ident> module gives a simple  way of
encoding the state of this manuscript, as  follows: 
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<div xml:id="instant"><head>Instant corrections</head>
<p>The use of elements such as <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi>
necessarily implies that the modifications they indicate were made at
some time after the original writing. An exception to this is where a
false start or <soCalled>instant</soCalled> correction has been
identified: the author starts to write, and then immediately corrects
what has been written. </p>
<p>The  <att>instant</att> attribute defined by this module may be
used on any element which is a member of the <ident
type="class">att.editLike</ident> class to modify this default assumption.
         When the value of <att>instant</att> is set to <val>true</val>, 
         the addition or deletion is considered to belong to the same layer as
         its parent element, while <code>false</code> means some layer
         later than that of its parent.</p>
      <p> An example of false start can be seen in the following line: <figure>

<note rend="ital">Add this as a new section before  PHTRXX ("Other
Primary Source Features not Covered")</note>
<p>A major purpose of genetic editing is the identification of
<soCalled>revision campaigns</soCalled> or, more generally,
<term>layers</term>. An editor may wish to assign a set of alterations
(deletions, additions, substitutions, transpositions, etc.) or any
other act of writing to a particular layer, to indicate both that one
or more of such phenomena preceded or followed another and also to
indicate that they are related in some way, for example that one is a
consequence of the other. To document this we need:
<list><item>a system to assign phenomena to a particular layer</item>
<item>a way to characterize a layer, in itself and in relation to
other layers.</item>
</list></p>
      
<p>The existing element <gi>creation</gi> (within the TEI Header
profile description) is defined as the appropriate location for all
information relating to the genesis or production of a text. We modify
it slightly to permit a new <gi>listLayer</gi> element which contains
a number of <gi>layer</gi> elements, one for each identified layer:
<listSpec>
            <specDesc key="listLayer" atts="ordered"/>
            <specDesc key="layer"/>
         </listSpec>
      </p>
      
<p>In the following example taken from the genetic edition of Goethe’s
Faust, the editor has identified four distinct layers:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <profileDesc>
            <creation>
               <listLayer ordered="true">
                  <layer xml:id="ST-1">First stage, written in ink by a writer</layer>
                  <layer xml:id="ST-2">Second stage, written in Goethe's hand using pencil</layer>
                  <layer xml:id="ST-3">Fixation of the revised passages and further revisions by
Goethe using ink</layer>
                  <layer xml:id="ST-4">Addition of another stanza in a          different hand,
probably at a later stage</layer>
               </listLayer>
            </creation>
         </profileDesc>
      </egXML>
      <p>The <gi>listLayer</gi> element carries an attribute <att>ordered</att>, which can take the
         values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> (the default). The attribute specifies
         whether the order of child elements signifies a temporal order for the revision campaigns
         which they document. In the Faust example above, the editor has asserted that the four
         stages distinguished are ordered chronologically according to the order of the
            <gi>layer</gi> elements. Note that asserting a specific order early on, though probably
         one of the hardest tasks in a genetic analysis, can considerably reduce the encoding effort
         in assigning textual alterations to stages during the transcription, as we will see below.
         For instance deletions can only be assigned to a stage that follows the one in which the
         passage being deleted was written down. Hence, having a certain order of stages put in
         place before transcription begins, will allow the encoder to reduce verbose tagging, where
         default assumptions based on the natural order of actions can be made.</p>
      <p>If necessary, <gi>listLayer</gi> elements can be nested hierarchically. This may be helpful
         in two cases. Firstly one can build up hypotheses about related revisions step-by-step,
         starting with stages of smaller coverage, whose members are certainly related, and then in
         a subsequent pass grouping these stages in turn, thereby extending their reach.</p>

      <p>In addition to the possibility of ordering text stages in relation to each other,
            <gi>layer</gi> elements may carry a number of attributes from the

      <p>Each <gi>layer</gi> element, apart from declaring a distinct layer in the creation of the
         document, may also contain references to other annotations contained within the
            <gi>teiHeader</gi> or in the document (as shown in the previous example). Such
         references, along with the textual content are purely documentary and do not affect the
         textual stage associated with any element thus referred to. The association of a textual
         component with a layer is always made explicitly, either by pointing from the
            <gi>layer</gi> attribute <att>target</att> to one or more elements, or (for preference)
         by pointing from the element concerned to the <gi>layer</gi> element by means of its
            <att>layer</att> attribute:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <line layer="#firstStage">This is a <subst layer="#secondStage">
               <del>house</del>
               <add>mouse</add>
            </subst>.</line>
      </egXML>
      <p>This simple example shows the latter of the two options: The relevant layers are declared
         in the header; then textual alterations and acts of writing are associated with. The above
         markup indicates that the whole sentence was realized in the first stage, while the
         substitution of “house” with “mouse” happened at the second stage. </p>

      <p>Note first, that a layer, once assigned to an element, is inherited by all descendants of
         that element unless overridden by a subsequent assignment. So in the example above the
         three verses are assigned to the first stage initially. The writing of
            <mentioned>Nun</mentioned> (as part of the substitution in the first verse) takes place
         in the second stage and is repeated or fixated in the third. Also the substitution in the
         second verse is done repeatedly: initially it takes place in the second stage, but is
         fixated as a whole in the third.</p>
      <p>The interpretation of layer assignments for a particular text passage is based on a number
         of implicit assumptions and constraints which have the effect of minimizing the amount of
         tagging necessary. The system is also flexible enough to support an explicit distinction
         between acts of writing and textual alterations, since either of these can be associated
         with layers described in the encoding. The following example shows an encoding in which the
         same passage is transcribed twice, once from a documentary perspective, and once from a
         textual one :</p>

      <p>The documentary transcription stresses the writing process, while the textual transcription
         emphasizes textual alterations. In either case, the layer of writing activity associated
         with a particular feature in the transcript is explicitly indicated. From the documentary
         perspective, the stage assignments describe the writing process, in that they specify,
         which segment has been written when and how often. From the textual perspective, the markup
         concentrates on the order of textual alterations and makes no assumptions about the order
         of writing.  In this example, the association is made by pointing from the <gi>layer</gi>
         element to all the passages and alterations in question in either perspective, which has
         the merit of not confusing the presentation of the interventions concerned with writing
         sequence information, at the price of requiring a distinct identifier on each intervention.
