            <head>About this Document</head>
            <p>This document describes a <hi rend="bold">draft</hi> encoding model for Genetic
               Editions and Genetic Editing. The document is the product of a Workgroup on Genetic
               Editions (chair: Fotis Jannidis), which is part of the TEI MS SIG (chairs: Elena
               Pierazzo, Malte Rehbein, Amanda Galley). </p>
            <p>The workgroup's goal was to develop an Application Profile for the encoding of
               genetic editions and, in general, genetic phenomena. It is expressed as a TEI P5
               conformant customization, integrating material from the existing TEI Guidelines,
               chiefly Chapter 11. <title>Representation of Primary Sources</title> and Chapter 12.
                  <title>Critical Apparatus</title>, together with additional new material. It may
               eventually, at the end of the process described in the following section, constitute
               a self standing new <title>Guidelines</title> chapter, or remain a set of
               recommendations for how to customize the Guidelines, but that is a decision for the
               TEI Council.</p>
            <p>The document reflects discussions held at a number of different meetings:</p>
            <list>
               <item>MS SIG meeting held in London during the annual members’ TEI meeting (November
                  2008); the minutes of the meeting can be found here: <ptr

               <item>Workshop "Genetic Editions in a Digital Framework", held in Paris, 14/15 May
                  2009, and following discussion; programme of the workshop can be found here: <ptr
                     target="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/GeneticEditionsWorkshopParis"/></item>
               <item>Genetic Edition workgroup held in Wuerzburg (September 2009)</item>
               <item>The document was extensively revised by Elena Pierazzo and Lou Burnard, for
                  presentation at a panel to be held at the Annual TEI Members Meeting in November
                  2009.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The work group was initially inspired by the <title>HNML. HyperNietzsche Markup
                  Language</title> and following versions (<title>GML Genetic Markup
                  Language</title>) produced by Paolo D'Iorio and colleagues from the HyperNietzsche
               project. We would like to thank Paolo D'Iorio for his invaluable contribution in the
               early stages of the work. </p>
            <div>
               <head>Work Plan</head>
               <p>The planned evolution of this document and the encoding model it describes may be
                  summarized as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Initially, we worked on a pseudo-encoding model, expressed using to our own
                     terminology. This stage was completed by July 2009. <!-- reference ? --></item>
                  <item>This pseudo-encoding model was re-expressed using the TEI P5 encoding
                     framework and revised extensively. </item>
                  <item>The same step-by-step approach will be taken for the standardisation
                     process: <list>
                        <item>First we develop an application profile, that is, a well-documented
                           TEI customisation.</item>
                        <item>This will be presented to the TEI Council as a proposed modification
                           of the TEI</item>
                        <item>If the TEI Council approves it, the Council will decide how it should
                           be integrated into the current <title>Guidelines</title>.</item>
                     </list></item>
               </list>
               <p>This draft document is publicly available for discussion and feedback from the
                  community. The document source is maintained in the TEI subversion repository at
                     <ptr target="http://tei.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tei/trunk/genetic/"/>;
                  information about the development of the proposals and associated materials,
                  including complete drafts of this document, are hosted on the TEI Wiki at <ptr
                     target="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Genetic_Editions"/>. </p>

               <head>Conventions used</head>
               <p>Although the entire document is a draft and therefore susceptible of changes, some
                  sections are less stable than others. In particular, when a section or a
                  particular element requires further discussion or is considered an open problem,
                  such a section or element is marked by a * mark.</p>
               <p>As required for TEI conformance, non-TEI elements are defined in a distinct
                  non-TEI namespace. In the usage examples and throughout this document that
                  namespace is mapped to the prefix <hi rend="bold">ge:</hi>, while TEI elements are
                  not marked by any namespace prefix.</p>

            <head>Theoretical Framework</head>
            <p>The genetic approach differs from other approaches to the study of texts because it
               aims not only to identify <q>what is on the page</q>, but also to reconstruct the
                  <emph rend="bold">process</emph> necessary to produce <q>what is on the
               page</q>.</p>
            <p>The encoding model for Genetic Editing must therefore handle:- <list>
                  <item>Genetic <term>transcription</term> of a single document in such a way as to
                     trace its evolution; </item>
                  <item>Genetic <term>reconstruction</term>: that is, creation of a <term>Genetic
                        Dossier</term> assembling multiple related documents, and description of the
                     genetic relations amongst them;</item>
                  <item>Genetic <term>editing</term>, the goal of which is preparation of a
                        <term>Genetic Edition</term> whether derived from a single or multiple
                     witnesses.</item>
               </list> A Genetic edition may be prepared by producing a full transcription of all
               extant witnesses, or by combining a full transcription of only one document (a
                  <term>base-text</term>) with information derived from other witnesses by means of
               automatic collation.</p>
            <p>Because our model aims to be independent of presuppositions associated with any
               particular theoretical framework, we begin by reviewing some typical dichotomies in
               editorial theory.</p>
            <div xml:id="deutung">
               <head>Fact vs. Interpretation</head>
               <p>In German editorial theory there is a well known opposition between what is there
                  in the source document, the <term>record</term> (<foreign xml:lang="deu" rend="it"
                     >Befund</foreign>), and the interpretation of this phenomenon (<foreign
                     xml:lang="deu" rend="it">Deutung</foreign>). This opposition implies that there
                  is a way to talk about the record without any interpretation. Yet at some possibly
                  simplistic level, everything we say about a text is based on interpretation,
                  particularly in the realm of genetic criticism.<note place="foot">See also the
                     TEI’s (implicit) position on this point: <q>we define markup, or (synonymously)
                        encoding, as any means of making explicit an <hi rend="italic"
                           >interpretation</hi> of a text</q> (TEI Guidelines: <ref
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">v. A
                        Gentle Introduction to XML</ref>). See also reference to Robinson and
                     Solopova 1993/1997: 21: <q>Any primary textual source… has its own semiotic
                        system within it.[…] The two semiotic system are materially distinct, in
                        that text written by hand is not the same as the text on the computer
                        screen</q>.</note> At the same time, there is an obvious difference between
                  the interpretation that some trace of ink is indeed a specific letter and the
                  assumption that a change in one line of a manuscript must have been made at the
                  same time as a change in another line because their effects are textually related
                  (for example, the first change was to a rhyming word, which necessitated the
                  second change). Therefore we propose to talk about differing <term>levels</term>
                  of interpretation, thus differentiating between <soCalled>what’s there</soCalled>
                  (document/fact) and <soCalled>how does it relate</soCalled>
                  (text/interpretation).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Status vs. Process</head>
               <p>When a scholar examines a written text, especially a manuscript, the object of the
                  investigation is usually to discover the final result of that writing and
                  rewriting process. The examination can take various forms: it can be approached
                  from a codicological/documentary point of view, ‘photographing’ the resulting
                  product, from a textual point of view, or from a genetic point of view, by trying
                  to describe the flow of authoring.</p>
               <p>The present proposal address both approaches: sections <ptr target="#document"/>
                  and <ptr target="#alterations"/> enable the codicological/documentary approach,
                  while all other sections investigates the process of writing and re-writing of the
                  text, and represent the proper genetic part of the present proposal.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Document vs. Text</head>
               <p>In Manuscript Studies (Editing, Codicology, Palaeography, Art History, History)
                  the first level of enquiry is always the document, the physical support that lies
                  in front of the scholar’s eyes. </p>
               <p>To understand the text that is contained in the manuscript, a deep study of the
                  manuscript itself is fundamental: the layout, the type of script, the type of
                  writing support, the binding and many other aspects are able to tell us about
                  when, where, and why this particular text was composed. The text therefore
                  represents a different level of enquiry: it is a construct, derived from the
                  reading of the documents.</p>
               <p>In the case of modern draft manuscripts scholars must give detailed consideration
                  to the layout, the different stratifications of writing and the disposition of
                  these in the physical space; all of these, together with an understanding of the
                  text, are required to gain insight about the composition, time of revisions, and
                  flow (<foreign xml:lang="fr">flux</foreign>) of the text. Furthermore, in some
                  cases, we know that the kind of physical support used to record it not only
                  influences but may also actually determine the text itself. For instance, the
                  content and the length of letters are often determined by the size and quantity of
                  the paper available to the writer; even more so for items such as postcards. </p>
               <p>The TEI has traditionally prioritised the text level. Of the two possible views
                  available to someone transcribing a primary source (text and document), the TEI
                  privileges the text (hence <hi rend="italic">Text</hi> Encoding Initiative). Such
                  physical or topographical information as a typical TEI encoding provides is
                  subordinate to the main structural encoding, whether because it is represented by
                  empty elements (<gi>pb/</gi>, <gi>lb/</gi>, <gi>cb/</gi>) or attributes (<gi>add
                     place=""</gi>, <gi>note place=""</gi>, or <att>rend</att>). The TEI thus
                  reflects the not uncommon view that, while relevant, documents are somehow less
                  relevant than the texts they embody; to use a bibliographical metaphor, texts are
                     <soCalled>substantial</soCalled> while documents are
                     <soCalled>accidental</soCalled>. </p>
               <p>However, for genetic editions, the ability to focus on the document is crucial. In
                  many cases, the only way to reconstruct the process of writing and re-writing
                  which leads to a new text is to examine a specific document. We therefore propose
                  to complement the existing text-focussed approach with a new encoding scheme
                  focussed instead on the document.</p>
               <p>We should then clarify the way we will use the following words:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><label>Document</label> the physical object, the manuscript or other primary
                     source, comprising one or more written surfaces</item>
                  <item><label>Text</label> the intellectual content of the document, the words
                     written in their logical (non physical) sequence</item>
                  <item><label>Facsimile</label> a surrogate representation (non necessarily
                     digital) of the document (a photograph, a microfilm, a digital image)</item>
                  <item><label>Document level</label> transcription of the content of a document
                     according to its physical layout</item>
                  <item><label>Text level</label> transcription of the content of a document
                     according to its logical, semantic meaning </item>
               </list>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Aspects of Genetic Editions</head>
            <p>Modern genetic editions describe the genetic process within one manuscript and over
               the course of two or more manuscripts, which are said to form part of a
                  <term>dossier</term>, that is, the set of documents which a genetic editor
               considers as having contributed to the evolution of a particular text, including
               associated diaries, letters, etc. Usually a view of a manuscript as a single
               self-contained object is also offered. This is because the manuscript view provides
               the material basis for the relationships established by the inter-manuscript
               relationship. Therefore we propose to differentiate between the following aspects of
               a genetic edition:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <label>Document level</label>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <label>The topological description</label> description of the layout of the
                        text and the basis for a rendition of a text as a diplomatic
                        transcription.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>Textual Alterations</label> like additions, deletions,
                        substitutions.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>Grouping Modifications</label> groups of changes at different
                        locations of one document, used to create sets which express the editorial
                        assumption that these changes have been undertaken in one stage.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>

               <p>We propose to introduce a new element, <gi>ge:document</gi> to encode a

                  element. A full TEI document may thus comprise: <list>
                     <item>a TEI Header, containing metadata</item>
                     <item>a TEI <gi>facsimile</gi> element, containing and describing visual
                        representations of a document</item>
                     <item>a <gi>ge:document</gi> element, containing a genetic transcription of a

                     <item>a TEI <gi>text</gi> element, containing an encoded version of the text
                        constructed from the document.</item>
                  </list>The header and at least one of the other three components must be present.
                  We do not discuss <gi>facsimile</gi> or <gi>text</gi> elements here; for these
                  refer to the published TEI Guidelines. </p>
               <p>In the simplest case, a document contains one or more written surfaces, of various
                  types (pages, for example). Each surface may contain one or more distinct written
                  zones of writing, each comprising one or more identifiable topographic lines. The
                  following elements are used to represent these basic components: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="document"/>
                     <specDesc key="surface" atts="type"/>
                     <specDesc key="zone" atts="rotate stage"/>
                     <specDesc key="line" atts="type"/>
                     <specDesc key="table"/>
                  </specList></p>
               <!-- remove @rotate? add something to describe writing orientation,
using SVG description of baseline; added to any zone, line 
simple case writing orientation on zone, or line;

-->
               <p>Like a <gi>facsimile</gi>, a <gi>ge:document</gi> contains information about the
                  written surfaces constituting a document. Because of this similarity, we would
                  like to use the same elements (<gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi>) as proposed in
                  the existing TEI scheme, although these place limits on what can be described.
                  Specifically, the <gi>zone</gi> element as currently defined can represent only a
                  rectangular area; it also lacks any way of stating the baseline applicable to any
                  writing contained within it </p>
               <p>The size of the writing surface is defined by a set of cartesian coordinates
                  measured from the top left corner. The co-ordinates of all zones identified within
                  the writing surface are given in terms of the same co-ordinates, as further
                  discussed in the TEI proposals for <gi>facsimile</gi>. It will often be the case
                  that explicit dimensions for a manuscript page (expressed in mm for example) are
                  also supplied in a <gi>msDesc</gi> element in the TEI Header, but this is not a
                  requirement; in particular there is no assumption that the co-ordinate system
                  defined by a <gi>surface</gi> maps to any particular external dimensions, nor that
                  the co-ordinate systems of different documents necessarily correspond. </p>
               <p>A <gi>surface</gi> element may contain any number of <gi>zone</gi>,
                     <gi>graphic</gi>, <gi>ge:line</gi> or <gi>table</gi>elements. The
                     <gi>graphic</gi> element is used to point to any graphic (non textual)
                  component forming part of the page, in the usual TEI manner. The <gi>zone</gi>
                  element is used to delimit any contiguous section of writing which the encoder
                  wishes to identify for some purpose. </p>
               <p>Zones can be nested and grouped, and can also overlap. Their positioning with
                  respect to the <gi>surface</gi> element is defined by coordinate values taken from
                  the same co-ordinate system as the surface itself, measured from the top left
                  corner. The element carries a <att>rotate</att> attribute which describes (in
                  degrees) the orientation of the surface with respect to the content (writing,
                  images) in that <gi>zone</gi>, with respect to its normal orientation. Note that
                  the mechanism aims to describes the process by which the content of a specific
                     <gi>zone</gi> has been supplied (i.e. the author has physically rotated the
                  writing surface) rather than the orientation of the writing.</p>
               <!-- fotis wants to generalise rotation to things other than zones 
actually he wants to kill it... -->
               <p>Zones are arbitrarily defined by the encoder according to the layout of the
                  writing surface and can make use of a standardised vocabulary (e.g. the top
                  margin). <!-- means what? --></p>
               <p>To overcome the inherent limitations of using the existing <gi>zone</gi> and
                     <gi>surface</gi> elements, we propose to extend their capability to include the
                  definition of arbitrary polygons and baselines, probably by embedding appropriate
                  elements from the Standard Vector Graphics (SVG) XML namespace. This work is not
                  yet complete however. </p>
               <!-- needs polygon as well as rectangle; define mapping -->
               <p>The attribute <att>stage</att> is used to indicate the <term>stage</term> in a
                  writing campaign to which this zone has been assigned by the encoder, as further
                  discussed in <ptr target="#stages"/> below. </p>
               <p>Within a zone, individual lines of writing are usually, but not necessarily,
                  distinguished using the <gi>ge:line</gi>. Zones can include <gi>table</gi>
                  elements also, as lines and tables represent the principal ways of organising
                  texts on a surface.<note>Can we have <gi>cell</gi> restricted to contain only what
                     is allowed within <gi>ge:line</gi>? Namely: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="model.pPart.transcriptional"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.pPart.editorial"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.hiLike"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.gLike"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.global"/>
                     </specList>
                  </note> In case of interlineated texts, interlinear writing can be treated as a
                  line on its own (perhaps characterised by a <att>type</att> attribute) or as
                  textual addition, encoded with an <gi>add</gi> (see below <ptr
                     target="#alterations"/>).</p>
               <p>In the following imaginary example, there are two main areas of writing, the diary
                  entry (black ink) and another (supposedly later) annotation in blue ink. <figure>
                     <graphic url="examples/D1.png" width="400px"/>
                  </figure> Note that the diary entry forms a zone which itself contains two zones:
                  one containing the date, and the other containing three lines about birds. The
                  five lines of annotation in blue ink form another zone, to record which the diary
                  page has been rotated 90° clockwise by the author. Using the elements discussed so
                  far, the page might be transcribed as follows:</p>

               <!--<p>[We need here an example discussing problem of interlinear markup
]</p>-->
               <p>Is it possible to combine both perspectives (documentary and textual views) within
                  a single encoding? In general a document-based transcription, which is done
                  page-by-page and possibly line-by-line, is almost certain to overlap with some
                  part of a the text-based structure. The cleanest solution may be to encode both
                  structures separately, providing both a <gi>ge:document</gi> and a distinct
                     <gi>text</gi> solution, perhaps using some form of external pointing to link
                  the two, and minimizing redundancy of encoding by using XInclude. This option is
                  further discussed below and also in the TEI Guidelines. </p>
               <p>A further, and possibly simpler, approach is to apply to the textual elements such
                  as <gi>p</gi> exactly the same kind of <soCalled>flattening</soCalled> approach as
                  has been applied to the <gi>ge:line</gi> elements in the preceding example.
                  Instead of marking the textual paragraphs as full elements, we mark only their
                  frontiers, using the standard TEI <gi>milestone</gi> element, with the addition of
                  a spanning attribute, as follows: <!-- D1_4.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <p>Elements <gi>zone</gi> and <gi>ge:line</gi> may contain a selection of phrase
                  level elements which have been considered essential to a document based
                  transcription, i.e: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="model.pPart.transcriptional"/>
                     <specDesc key="model.pPart.editorial"/>

                     <specDesc key="model.global"/>
                  </specList> The element also include a generic in-line element such as
                     <gi>seg</gi>, but which content is limited to the same content allowed by
                     <gi>ge:line</gi>.<!-- TODO: refer to model.zonePart/linePart as an extension point for the content model -->
                  <note place="foot">Can we limit the content of seg within this

                     point is left open for the Council to evaluate.</note> This element can
                  therefore be used to encode any semantic aspect of the transcribed document (e.g.
                  dates or names), but it is recommendable that such an approach is kept to a
                  minimum. In case extensive semantic markup is to be applied, the textual
                  perspective should be preferred or included alongside, as suggested above. </p>
               <p>The written surfaces of which a document is composed are not always homogenous. In
                  the following example, taken from the Walt Whitman archive, two pieces of
                  newsprint have been glued to a piece of blue paper on which a poem is being
                  drafted: <figure>
                     <graphic url="examples/whitman01.jpg" width="400px"/>
                     <head rend="it">Image from
                        http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/duk.00258.001.jpg</head>
                  </figure> The two pieces of newsprint might perhaps be regarded as special kinds
                  of zone, but they are effectively new surfaces, since they might contain
                  additional written zones themselves (such as the numbers in this case). We
                  therefore propose a distinct element, <gi>ge:patch</gi>, which can appear within a
                     <gi>surface</gi>, and behaves effectively like one, except that it contains
                  specialized attributes to provide additional information. <specList>
                     <specDesc key="patch" atts="binder type height width"/>
                  </specList> Using this element, the Whitman draft above might be encoded as
                  follows: <!-- whitman01.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  discussed below (<ptr target="#mm"/>)</p>
               <p>Surfaces can also be damaged, thorned and cut. In this cases a combination of
                     <gi>damageSpan</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements could be used. <specList>
                     <specDesc key="damageSpan" atts="group"/>
                     <specDesc key="gap"/>
                  </specList> Let's suppose that a piece of paper has been cut off from the page
                  (encoded within a <gi>surface</gi>), and that we can infer the dimensions of the
                  missing piece; this could be encoded as follows: <!-- damageSpan_1.xml --><egXML
                     xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">

                     </surface>
                  </egXML> In the example an empty <gi>zone</gi> element has been provided in order
                  to give the coordinates of the missing piece of <gi>surface</gi>, assuming that
                  those are reconstructible. In case a full page is missing, <gi>damageSpan</gi> can
                  be used within <gi>ge:document</gi>, perhaps in conjunction with a <gi>gap</gi>
                  element. <!-- damageSpan_2.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <ge:document>

                     </ge:document>
                  </egXML> Let's then suppose that the missing folio is luckily found somewhere; in
                  this case it is likely that the editor might want to encode the two statuses of
                  the document, before and after the damage, tracing the genesis of the document as
                  well as the genesis of the text. In these cases the same mechanism that can be
                  used to describe the genetic history of the text can be used to describe the
                  genesis of the document (see below <ptr target="#stages"/>), which consist in the
                  usage of a <att>stage</att> attribute connected to the <gi>ge:stageNote</gi>
                  section. <!-- damageSpan_3.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                        <gap extent="1" unit="folio" stage="#stage2">

                  </egXML> In the example the two recovered pages (two sides of the missing folio)
                  have been referenced via the <att>corresp</att> attribute, assuming that they
                  would have encoded in a separate document (they could, if wished, be encoded
                  within the same document, providing a content to the empty <gi>surface</gi>s);
                     <gi>damageSpan</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> belong to a second stage in the life of
                  the document; the descriptions of <val>#stage1</val> and <val>#stage2</val> can be
                  found in the header, within the <gi>ge:stageNote</gi> section.</p>

               <p>Traces of authorial alteration (correction, addition, deletion, etc.) are
                  frequently found within a single document, and may also be inferred when different
                  documents are compared. It is however an open question as to whether
                  inter-document discrepancies at the dossier level should be regarded in the same
                  way as intra-document alterations. If two witnesses are collated, we may observe
                  that a word present in one is missing from the other: does it necessarily follow
                  that this is an addition or a deletion, which we would not hesitate to mark with
                  an <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> tag if we are transcribing a single manuscript? We
                  return to this question <ref target="#collation">below</ref>.
                  <!-- Or do we need a completely new
set of elements to do it? In a genetic process, at any point the
author can decide to stop revising the text within a given document
and decide to move to a new document (i.e. copy it anew), so the two
phenomena (alterations at document level and alterations at dossier
level) are indeed closely related. On the other hand we need to
differentiate them because the one within a single document is
explicitly marked by the author, while the one detected by comparison
is only implicit. It may also happen that implicit alterations were
perhaps marked in a lost intermediate version. This remains an open
problem (see .</p> <p>The following discussion-->
               </p>
               <p>In this section we discuss elements introduced for the markup of alterations at
                  the document level, within a single document, complementary to the elements
                  already provided for this purpose by the TEI scheme. We discuss specifically: <list>
                     <item><soCalled>meta-marks</soCalled>, that is a kind of authorial markup
                        present in the source and indicating how it should be read; </item>
                     <item>additions, where a passage has been rewritten to fix or clarify it; </item>
                     <item>deletions, where a passage had been struck through to indicate that it
                        has been removed, or where a deletion has itself been cancelled</item>
                     <item>transpositions, where passages have been reorganized or resequenced.
                     </item>

               </p>
               <p>The TEI already provides the following basic elements for transcription, which

                  elements to the same class: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="metaMark" atts="function  targets"/>

                  </specList> Each of these new elements is discussed in the remainder of this
                  section.</p>
               <p>All these elements (the TEI's and ne new ones) imply a certain level of semantic
                  interpretation; for instance the usage of the <gi>add</gi> element to encode, say,
                  interlinear insertions, already imply a certain level of interpretation, but when
                  transcribing from a documentary perspective, it may be desirable to keep separate
                  recording is on the page from what is the editor interpretation (see <ptr
                     target="#deutung"/>). Therefore the present proposal also introduces two generic
                  elements, <gi>ge:mod</gi> and <gi>ge:modSpan</gi>, to encode any kind of modification,
                  which can be typed or described via the <att>rend</att> attribute. <specList>

               <div>
                  <head>Additions and rewritings</head>
                  <p>A writer may sometimes rewrite material a second time without significant
                     change and in the same place. We consider this a distinct activity from
                     addition as usually defined because no new textual material results but the
                     status of existing material changes. We distinguish two variants of this:
                        <term>fixation</term> where the first version was a tentative draft which is
                     subsequently fixed, for example by inking it over; and
                        <term>clarification</term>, where the first version was badly written and
                     has been rewritten for clarity. The element <gi>ge:rewrite</gi> is provided to
                     cover both cases. </p>
                  <p>In this simple example, taken from the papers of Henrik Ibsen, the writer wrote
                     the word <mentioned>skuldren</mentioned> hastily, and then returned to it to
                     make the letter <mentioned>l</mentioned> larger and clearer: <figure>

                  </p>
                  <p>The following example, taken from a manuscript of Jane Austen's
                        <title>Sanditon</title>, shows a rewriting where a pencilled passage has
                     been fixed with ink, with some modification: <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/AusSand70.png" width="400px"/>
                        <head rend="it">Image from page 70 of the Sanditon manuscript</head>
                     </figure> In this example, Austen sees in the fixation an opportunity to
                     manipulate the text previously written, and thus changes the pencilled
                        <mentioned> could but get a young</mentioned> to the inked <mentioned>could

                     pencilled <mentioned>but</mentioned>. A simple way of encoding this might be as
                     follows: <!-- AusSand70.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     </egXML> where the <att>stage</att> attribute groups the operations that belong
                     to the rewriting stage, assuming an implied previous stage (the first layer of
                     writing). In case the first layer need to be addressed independently, another
                     URI can be added to the <att>stage</att> attribute:  <!-- AusSand70.xml --><egXML

                     of such stages in the header, the first one conventionally representing the
                     first layer of writing and the second the rewriting stage. </p>

                  <head>Deletions and marked as used</head>
                  <p>In general deletion in a source is marked using the <gi>del</gi> or
                        <gi>delSpan</gi> element. However, it is useful to distinguish cases where a
                     passage has been <q>indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an
                        author, scribe, annotator, or corrector</q> (TEI P5, s.v. <gi>del</gi>) from
                     cases where a passage has been struck through or otherwise marked as having
                     been used or copied to another location. In this latter case, the author does
                     not intend to suppress the content, but only to mark that it has been
                     transferred or reused. The element <gi>ge:used</gi> is provided to mark this
                     kind of <soCalled>deletion</soCalled>.</p>
                  <p>The following page from the Walt Whitman archive has been crossed through to
                     indicate used material: <figure>

                     </figure> This page contains many internal deletions, but these should be
                     distinguished from the <soCalled>deletion</soCalled> signalled by the large
                     cross, which actually shows that the page has been transferred or re-used, not
                     deleted. </p>
                  <p>Material marked as re-used in this way often spans more than one zone or line.
                     For that reason, the <gi>ge:used</gi> element is a spanning element, indicating
                     the end of the used area by means of a <att>spanTo</att> attribute. We might

                  <p>By <term>metamark</term> we mean marks such as numbers, arrows, crosses, or
                     other symbols introduced by the writer into a document expressly for the
                     purpose of indicating how the text is to be read. Such marks thus constitute a
                     kind of markup of the document, rather than forming part of the text. </p>
                  <p>Unlike marginal notes or other additions to the text, meta-marks indicate a
                     deliberate alteration of the writing (e.g. <q>move this passage over
                     there</q>). We also consider as metamarks dates introduced to mark the
                     beginning of a manuscript or a revision, but not forming part of it.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>ge:metaMark</gi> element carries a <att>function</att> attribute which
                     specifies the function of the meta-mark and a <att>target</att> attribute which
                     points to the element or elements concerned. </p>
                  <p>The following example is taken from <title>Kundige bok 2</title>, a 15th
                     century legal book from the city of Göttingen, containing regulations of
                     everyday life issued by the city council <figure>

                        xml:lang="lat">lege</mentioned> ("read") in the left hand margin,
                     functioning as a metamark to indicate that this sentence forms part of the
                     regulations. A further sentence was then added, while at some later stage or
                     stages the text and also the metamark were deleted. We might encode this as

                  <p>Here are some further examples showing the use of this element, taken from the
                     manuscript drafts of Thomas Moore's <title>Lalla Rookh</title>
                     (1817)<!--, provided by Justin Tonra, NUIG-->. The first shows a simple use of
                     a metamark used to take stock of the progress of composition: <figure>

                  </p>
                  <p>At regular points throughout the various drafts of the work, a number occurs,
                     usually in the right margin (in this instance, "100"). These numbers result
                     from the author counting the number of verse lines he has composed to the given
                     point, and are not part of the text, but represent a stage at which Moore is
                     taking stock of the progress of his composition. </p>

                     </figure> This example demonstrates the use of a common proof-correction mark:
                     in the left margin of the page, adjacent to a group of three cancelled lines of
                     verse, the word "stet" is written. "Stet", a Latin word meaning "let it stand"
                     is commonly used by authors, editors and proofreaders where a previous action
                     should be disregarded. In this instance, Moore is indicating that the three
                     deleted verse lines should be let stand, as evidenced by their appearance in
                     the first printed edition of <title>Lalla Rookh</title>. The word, "stet" does
                     not form part of the text, but rather declares that a certain function be
                     performed upon the text. <!-- moore03.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     </figure> In this example two alternative readings are provided, without either
                     one being prioritised or subordinated. While the author apparently first
                     composed the line "Alone before his native river -", at some later point, he
                     entertained the possibility of using the word "beside" instead of "before." In
                     the context of this manuscript, there is no indication of which word the Moore
                     favours, so the status of these words as possible alternative readings needs to
                     be encoded. The evidence of the first edition of <title>Lalla Rookh</title>
                     shows that the word "beside" was chosen, but for the purposes of encoding this
                     manuscript, the facility to encode two equally-possible alternative readings
                     needs to be available. </p>

                     Note here the use of the existing TEI element <gi>alt</gi> to indicate
                     that the three elements indicated are mutually exclusive alternates:  the word

                     written at the bottom of the page. Since <mentioned>estranged</mentioned> is
                     underlined, the editors argue  (loc cit pp. 155-162)
                     that  this possibility is to be preferred to the others and hence give it a

                  <head>Transpositions</head>
                  <p>Metamarks are commonly used in the context of <term>transposition</term>, that
                     is, the moving of words or blocks by the author to a different position using
                     arrows, asterisks or numbers or other metamarks. One possible approach (used,
                     for instance in HNML) would be to regard such transpositions as a special kind
                     of substitution, and actually to represent the result of the transposition
                     indicated by the metamarks in the encoding, for example by considering the
                     segment previous to the transposition as deleted, and substituted by the one
                     after the transposition. </p>
                  <p>Our recommendation is to record the actual state of the witness, but in such a
                     way as to facilitate its reorganization as a distinct processing step. We
                     propose to represent the re-alignment of transposed blocks or segments by means
                     of a stand-off mechanism. The elements <gi>ge:transposeGrp</gi> and
                        <gi>ge:transpose</gi> are provided for this purpose. For example, in the
                     following extract from an Ibsen manuscript <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/ibsen01.jpg" width="400px"/>

                     </figure>, the underlined numbers 1 and 2 indicate that, although the word
                        <mentioned>bör</mentioned> precedes the word <mentioned>hör</mentioned> in
                     the text, the order of the two words should be reversed. We may encode this as
                     follows: <!-- ibsen01.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <p>In the current model for the TEI <gi>subst</gi> element, one or more additions
                     and deletions may be combined if they are considered as representing a single
                     editorial act, a substitution. Without extension, this model could not
                     therefore include cases such as the following example taken from Thomas Moore's
                        <title>Lalla Rooke</title>
                     <figure>

                     all of this as a single substitution. This would require a modification to the

                  <head>Undoing alterations</head>
                  <p>In some cases an author indicates that an alteration is itself to be altered:
                     for example, a struck through passage may be restored via a dotted underlining,
                     or the underlining of a passage may be deleted by a wavy line. </p>
                  <!-- need a simpler example first, need to discuss relation with restore -->
                  <p>The TEI provides an element <gi>restore</gi> for one specific kind of
                     alteration to an alteration, namely the undoing of a deletion. We propose a
                     more general element, <gi>ge:undo</gi>. The element <gi>ge:undo</gi> usually
                     encloses the element (e.g. the <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi> etc.) to be undone.
                     If it appears within such an element, the implication is that only this part of
                     the parent element has been cancelled. For example, in this passage taken from
                     Giacomo Leopardi's <title>Zibaldone</title> (p. 3595), the phrase <mentioned>si
                        rechi á</mentioned> was underlined word by word, and then the underlining of
                     the word <mentioned>si</mentioned> was cancelled. <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/leop01.png" width="400px"/>
                     </figure>This could be encoded as follows: <!-- leop01.xml --><egXML

                  <!-- not sure I remember what we said but it seems to me we decided to 
                  point from the undo to the element to be undone-->
                  <p>To make explicit the relation between the undoing act and the initial act, we
                     propose an alternative way of encoding these scribal acts, namely an empty
                        <gi>ge:undo</gi> element, targeting at the intial question in action. In
                     case that more than one (not coherent) part of the deletion is undone, the undo
                     statement needs to be repeated with the concerned parameters.</p>
                  <p>In the following example, three text stages can be identified: <list><item>s1
                           (initial): This is just some sample text, we need a real example.

                  <p>The use of tags such as <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> necessarily implies that the modification concerned was
                     made at some time after the original writing. An exception to this is where a false start or
                        <soCalled>instant</soCalled> correction has been identified: the author starts to write, and then
                     immediately corrects what has been written. A special mechanism is provided for this case: an
                        <att>instant</att> attribute has been introduced to <ident>att.editLike</ident>, whose datatype is
                        <ident>data.xTruthValue</ident> and <code>false</code> is the default value. When the value of <att>instant</att>
                     is <code>true</code> this indicates that the addition or deletion is considered to belong to the same writing
                     stage as the rest of the unmodified document, while <code>false</code> means some stage later than the current
                     stage.</p>
                  <p> An example of false start can be seen in the following line: <figure>

                     <head>http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/uva.00256.001.jpg</head></figure> in which we can detect
                     the following sequence of events: <list type="ordered"><item>The letter T is written and then immediately
                        deleted</item><item>The word The is written, deleted, and replaced by the word His</item><item>The added

                              capital I</item></list> To indicate that the first of these acts must have taken place before the others, we

                     <gi>mod</gi> spans should not be nested within each other, where for example
                     several revision campaigns have been identified which are applicable to

               <p>Since a dossier needs to be assembled from many documents, which will most probably be encoded in distinct TEI
                  documents, one way to assemble a dossier’s contents for further processing would be to (re-)use the existing
                     <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element in combination with <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XML Inclusions
                     (XInclude)</ref>. The corpus construct on the one hand provides for a common place, in which metadata regarding
                  the organization of the dossier itself can be recorded, independently of the metadata regarding each particular
                  document contained within it, which would be held in a discrete TEI Header attached to that particular encoded
                  document. The XInclude mechanism on the other hand provides a convenient means of managing the many separate
                  resources which are likely to be needed to constitute a complete dossier. For example, supposing we have a dossier

               <head>Genetic Graphs</head>
               <p>Looking at the documents which constitute a given dossier, there are many types of relationships which can be
                  identified, both amongst complete documents, and amongst parts of those documents, including alterations,
                  revisions, stages and other compositional phenomena. A further complexity arises if for example an author chooses
                  to correct two different versions at the same time,<note place="foot">Manzoni, for instance, used to modify an old
                     draft to see how a new variant fitted with the context before copying it into a new draft.</note>. We may thus
                  need to express that two or more documents are related in different ways; for instance, one document may be the
                  sequel of another, one may have been drafted at the same time as another, one may contain material or treat topics
                  related to those of another, for example a newspaper article may inspire or be quoted by a given work.</p>
               <p>We propose to model the <soCalled>genetic relations</soCalled> one can deduce from such penomena by means of a
                     <term>graph</term>. <note place="foot">Graph-like data structures have many applications. An early proposal to

                  </note> A graph is a mathematical representation composed of <term>node</term>s and <term>arcs</term>. Nodes
                  represent objects, which are related: Typical objects in our case are documents, document components, text stages
                  (as defined in <ptr target="#stages"/> below) or even single phenomena (acts of writing or a textual alterations).
                  Each arc between two nodes then represents a relation, again in our case a genetic relation between the two
                  respective objects, that the arc connects. Arcs may be typed and directed, both to further specify the kind of
                  relationship they represent. For our purposes one can also assume, that a typical genetic graph is directed and
                  acyclic, because we generally expect the <term>paths</term> through a genetic graph (formally defined as an
                  ordered set of nodes traversed by following its arcs) to represent genetic processes with an implied chronological
                  order. This way a genetic graph may resemble a family tree, in that there is a single terminal node, representing the
                  final/ published version of a text, with many preceding nodes linking to it, either directly or via other nodes,
                  each of those representing draft versions of various parts. Alternatively, there may be more than one final state,
                  e. g. in the case of multiple published texts or unpublished fragments.</p>
               <p>A visual representation of an exemplary genetic graph might look as follows:<figure>
                  <graphic url="examples/geneticRel.png" width="400px"/>
               </figure></p>
               <p>What can be seen here is on a very abstract level: The nodes (drawn as rectangular shapes with letters) represent
                  parts of the dossier, the directed arcs (drawn as lines with arrows) represent relationships between the parts
                  (probably of an evolutionary type). Thus the graph can be read as A and B being precursors of C, C in turn leading
                  to F, F to G, G to H, and H leading to the final state Z, which additionally draws influences from E and D.</p>
               <p>All these abstract information can be encoded with the following elements (see also the Guidelines’ chapter 19.
                  “Graphs, Networks, and Trees”): <specList>

               <head>Constructing genetic graphs</head>
               <p>It is highly unlikely, that editors will construct and encoded genetic graphs by hand, unless the dossier is as
                  simply structured as the given example. Rather a typical workflow might be:</p>
               <list type="ordered"> 
                  <item>The editor transcribes each witness in a separate TEI document.</item>
                  <item>During the transcription process phenomena of genetic relevance are annotated with identifiers, that
                     classify these phenoma as belonging to a certain genetic process or that simply relates these phenomena in a
                     well-defined way.</item>
                  <item>By automatically collecting and evaluating all those annotations from all transcribed documents, a
                  preliminary graph is constructed, that can be visualized and navigated.</item>
                  <item>Steps 1-3 are repeated up to the point, where the graph cannot be further refined via this procedure.</item>
                  <item>Optionally, the automatically constructed graph can be annotated manually.</item>

               <p>This allows to express genetic relations by annotating the same verse or the even the same interval of verses in
                  different witnesses/stages/variants with the one as given in the final text (e.g. 354-359). Although a genetic
                  graph generated from the coindexed verses will not be of a very fine granularity, it can very well serve as base
                  for refinement. Incorporating metadata of the witnesses (especially dating information) and collation results
                  among other relevant information, the graph can be enriched in an iterative way and periodically checked for
                  consistency. In the end, together with the transcriptions, collation results and a critical apparatus it can be
                  archived as an integral part of the genetic edition.</p>

            <head>*Collation and Critical Apparatus</head>
            <p>As noted <ref target="#alteration">above</ref>, not all kinds of variation within and
               between documents are equivalent. For example, most people would regard authorial
               modifications within a single draft or between subsequent drafts as having a
               different significance from modifications assigned to scribal variation within a long
               textual tradition, despite their formal similarities.</p>
            <p>When a passage has been visibly deleted in one version of a text we will generally
               mark it explicitly; if however a passage present in one version (A) is omitted in
               another (B), it may be a matter of uncertainty as to whether it has been deleted from
               B, or added to A. Even if this is certain (perhaps because the order of the two
               versions is known), the omission from B of material in A is not entirely the same
               phenomenon as an explicit deletion.</p>
            <p>The addition (or deletion) of a segment from a version is normally a deliberate act
               of the author and we would like to be able to record that in positive way; whether we
               need another set of editorial elements or we should use the same set that are used
               for transcription remains an open question. </p>
            <p>Identifying additions or deletions on the basis of a comparison of different versions
               of a text is possible, using existing TEI elements for critical editing such as
                  <gi>app</gi> and its child <gi>rdg</gi> elements. This method uses the argument
                  <foreign xml:lang="lat">e silentio</foreign>: for example, to identify that
               something is missing from a witness, all available readings must be compared, and
               there is no way of explicitly marking an absent (or additional) reading. For
               instance, the 1856 edition of <title>Leaves of Grass</title>of the 1856 omits the
               words <soCalled>all, all</soCalled> which are included in the 1881-82 version. We may
               record this as an apparatus: <!-- app.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions <app>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves81-82">, all, all</rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
                     </app> sleep</l>
               </egXML> but this does not indicate whether the words were deleted consciously from
               the 1856 dedition, or added in the 1881 version. Furthermore, if we decided to use
               the existing <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> elements within the <gi>rdg</gi>, for
               example: <!-- app.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions <app>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves81-82">
                           <add>, all, all</add>
                        </rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
                     </app>...</l>
               </egXML> the result would be ambiguous: it might indicate that there is an explicit
               addition (for example, by interlinear or marginal interpolation) within the 1881
               text, or it might indicate that this addition appears as a result of collating the
               1881 and 1856 texts. </p>

<list >
   <item>Only one document has been entirely transcribed (perhaps the first or
             the last version), while the others are only reconstructable via
             collation, which can be stored within the same document or in a separate
             one.</item>

             collation is stored in a separate document</item>
</list></p>
    <div>
<head>One document is transcribed</head>
<p>If, beside the base-text which is fully transcribed, all extant witnesses
          have to be reconstructed via collation, it is essential to be able to
          distinguish alterations that happen within them and between witnesses. For
          instance, using the existing tag set we could possibly encode as follows:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions<app>
     <lem wit="#Leaves81-82">
 <add>, all, all</add>
     </lem>
     <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
  </app> sleep</l>
   </egXML></p>
<p>Nevertheless, this might force the intended usage of <gi>add</gi> as it
          might imply that there is an addition (interlinear, marginal or wherever) on
          the edition 1881-82 (a problem which will certainly be magnified with
          manuscripts) which is not the case. -->
            <p>One solution might be to use a different element (say <gi>ge:interAdd</gi>) for
               addition implied by collation, reserving <gi>add</gi> for deletions that happen at
               the document level. Another, if all the documents have been fully transcribed, might
               be to use stand off techniques to represent the collation. This is a more promising
               possibility which the workgroup has not yet fully explored. If all the alterations
               occurring at document level are already encoded within each transcription, the
               dossier-level collation will only need to point to passages within the separate files
               and classify the types of readings resulting from the collation: <!-- app.xml --><egXML

               <p>A major purpose of genetic editing is the identification of <soCalled>revision campaigns</soCalled> or, more
                  generally, <term>stages</term>. A genetic editor needs to be able to assign a set of alterations (deletions,
                  additions, substitutions, transpositions, etc.) and/or an act of writing to a particular stage, to indicate both
                  that one or more of such phenomena preceded or followed another and also to indicate that they are related in some
                  way, for example that one is a consequence of the other. To document this we need: <list>
                     <item>a system to assign phenomena to a particular stage</item>
                     <item>a way to characterize a stage, in itself and in relation to other stages.</item></list></p>
               <p>The existing element <gi>creation</gi> (within the TEI Header profile description) is defined as the appropriate
                  location for all information relating to the genesis or production of a text. We might therefore modify it
                  slightly to permit a new <gi>stageNotes</gi> element which contains a number of <gi>stageNote</gi> elements, one
                  for each identified stage.</p>
               <p>For example in the following snippet taken from the genetic edition of Goethe’s Faust, the editor identified four
                  distinct stages:</p>

               <p>Any <gi>stageNote</gi> element as well as the <gi>stageNotes</gi> container posesses an attribute <att>type</att>,
                  which can take the values <code>unordered</code> or <code>ordered</code>. If the attribute is not present,
                     <code>unordered</code> is assumed by default. The attribute specifies whether the order of child elements
                  signifies a temporal order of the respective revision campaigns. So in the Faust example, not only did the editor
                  identify four stages, but she also states, that these four stages are ordered chronologically according to
                  the order of the <gi>stageNote</gi> elements.</p>
               <p>Optionally <gi>stageNote</gi> elements can be nested, thereby forming a hierarchy. This may be helpful in two
                  cases. Firstly one can build up hypotheses about related revisions step-by-step, starting with stages of smaller
                  coverage, whose members are certainly related, and then in a subsequent pass grouping these stages in turn,
                  thereby extending their reach.</p>

               <p>This example shows the latter of the two options: At first the relevant stages are declared in the header; then
                  textual alterations and acts of writing are assigned to them. Note also, that a stage, once assigned to an
                  element, is inherited by all descendents of that element, unless overridden by a subsequent assignment. So in the
                  given example the three verses are assigned to the first stage initially. The writing of “Nun” (as part of the
                  substitution in the first verse) takes place in the second stage and is repeated (aka. rewritten/fixated) in the
                  third. Also the substitution in the second verse is done repeatedly: initially it takes place in the second
                  stage, but is fixated as a whole in the third.</p>
               <!-- TODO: Difference between acts of writing and textual alteration; e. g. <del/> takes place in the another 
               stage then the writing of its contents-->
               <p>The other mode of assignment is illustrated by the following example:</p>

               <p>The chronology (timing) of parts of a document or documents may be expressed in
                  absolute terms (at such a time on such a date), or relatively (before or after
                  some other event). Relative time can also be expressed by the relation to the
                  (known or unknown) creation of another document or text. Dating can be justified
                  by prose and/or by reference to a characteristic of a manuscript (e.g. hand, ink,
                  etc.). The outlining of a chronology for a document or dossier can then be used as
                  an argument to determine the dating of a text-stage.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>Absolute Time</head>
                  <p>For absolute timing we envisage two cases that can occur separately or in
                     combination: <list>
                        <item>The dating of a witness (a manuscript part of a dossier) or of a
                           division is not directly documented within its content, but can be
                           deduced from external facts and documents. The editorial date attribution
                           should be included in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, within the
                              <gi>creation</gi> element. </item>
                        <item>Dates can be found in the document added by the author as a kind of
                           metadata (for instance the date of the beginning/ending of writing on a
                           specific document, or the date of a revision campaign); those should be
                           encoded without necessarily adding them in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> (they
                           can be considered a type of <term>meta-mark</term>, as previously
                           discussed (<ptr target="#mm"/>)</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The TEI provides a <gi>timeline</gi> element which can be used to define a
                     scale, a co-ordinate system for measuring time. This enables us to align other
                     components of a document with particular points in time, each such point being
                     represented by a <gi>when</gi> element. The temporal inter-relation of
                        <gi>when</gi> elements is expressed by attributes stating, for example, that
                     this point in time is so many hours or years after another, or absolutely using
                     a standardized notation for date and time (see further discussion in the
                     Guidelines). The alignment is done using an attribute such as <att>sync</att>,
                     to state that a given part of the text is aligned with a given point in time. </p>
                  <p>This mechanism was developed originally for the representation of transcribed
                     speech, in particular to support overlap and discontinuity at a fairly
                     fine-grained level. It is not clear to what extent it can be generalised to
                     support the comparatively coarse grained and imprecise notions which typify
                     analysis of textual genesis. In particular, the need to express alternative and
                     uncertain temporal sequences remains problematic. </p>
                  <p>One option might be to define a specific element such as <gi>ge:evolution</gi>
                     comprising a series of pointers to <gi>change</gi> elements, organized in such
                     a way as to express alternative or varyingly certain views about their
                     sequence, possibly using the existing TEI <gi>alt</gi> element, and existing
                     featurs for indicating degrees of uncertainty. Such pointers could also be
                     synchronized with an external timeline using the existing TEI mechanisms if
                     this was thought useful. The Workgroup has not completed work on elaborating
                     these proposals however. </p>

, the content model of <gi>timeline</gi> has been enlarged to
          accept a <gi>choice</gi> element; <gi>timelene</gi> can then also be used
          within <gi>choice</gi>. The <gi>when</gi> element has been modified to
          include editorial attributes like <att>cert</att>, <att>resp</att>,
 <att>evidence</att> and <att>source</att>, therefore in case of a date
          written in the manuscript by the author, like for Austen's
 <title>Persuasion</title>, we will have: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <when target="#pers-1" absolute="1816-07-08" evidence="internal"
  cert="high" source="#date-1"/>
   </egXML> Otherwise, in case of a conjectural date discussed in several parts
          of the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, we will have: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <when target="#t2" absolute="1922" precision="low" evidence="conjecture"
  cert="medium" source="#inkanalysis"/>

<p>As an example, let's consider again the analysis provided by Kenneth Price
          and Brett Barney on Whitman's <title>The Sleepers</title> (<ptr
             target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/sleepers.html"
          />), and let's assume that the order in which the witnesses are presented in
          the website is a chronological order; let's also assume that the chronology
          of two witnesses (the one titled <title>[become a shroud]</title> and the
          one titled <title>[I am a curse]</title>) is uncertain, the encoding could
          be as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <timeline origin="#poem" desc="dossier timeline">
  <when target="#poem"/>
  <when target="#sweet_flag"/>
  <when target="#curse1"/>
  <when target="#efflux"/>
  <choice>
     <timeline origin="#shroud" weights="0.8">
 <when target="#shroud"/>
 <when target="#curse2"/>
     </timeline>
     <timeline origin="#curse2" weights="0.8">
 <when target="#shroud"/>
 <when target="#curse2"/>
     </timeline>
  </choice>
  <when target="#topple_down"/>
  <when target="#black_lucifer"/>

  <when target="#Leaves81-82" absolute="1881" evidence="internal"/>
 </timeline>
   </egXML>

<p>The example show how to order witnesses within a dossier, but the same model
          can be used to order text stages or variants within a section.</p>

<head>Relative Time</head>
<p>Relative time can be expressed in various ways: </p>
<list >
   <item>In the easiest case it might be a direct relationship: <att>next</att>,
  <att>previous</att>, <att>sync</att>, or as a “sorting” relationship:
  <att>before</att>, <att>after</att>.</item>
   <item>In some cases one may be able to express the relative timing of a
             section or a passage marked by the <gi>ge:mod</gi> element. This can be
             expressed via a numbering scheme (<val>0</val>, <val>1</val>,
  <val>2</val>, …) within a <att>seq</att> attribute. In this case we
             assume a <hi rend="bold">default</hi> time-line (the time of writing and
             of the <ref target="#instCor">instant corrections</ref>) which is
             represented by <val>0</val>, and successive revision-times (<val>1</val>,
  <val>2</val>, etc.)</item>
   <item>More complex situation could be expressed via the <gi>timeline</gi>
             element, as seen before. In this case, when the attribute
  <att>absolute</att> is present, an absolute time is assumed, when
             absent, a relative time is assumed; in this way absolute and relative
             time can be used together. In case it is necessary to express
             simultaneity, the attributes <att>interval</att> and <gi>since</gi> could
             be used as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <when xml:id="t1" target="#poem"/>
  <when xml:id="t2" interval="0" since="#t1" target="#sweet_flag"/>
