            <head>About this Document</head>
            <p>This document contains a <hi rend="bold">draft</hi>  encoding model for
               Genetic Editions and Genetic Editing. The document is the product of a Workgroup on
               Genetic Editions (chair: Fotis Jannidis), which is part of the TEI MS SIG (chairs:
               Elena Pierazzo, Malte Rehbein, Amanda Galley). </p>
            <p>The workgroup's goal was develop an <hi
            rend="bold">Application Profile</hi> for the encoding of
            genetic editions and, in general, genetic phenomena.  Such
            a profile would customize and possibly extend the existing
            TEI elements for the purpose of encoding genetic editions
            and genetic phenomena. It would be expressed initially as
            a TEI P5 conformant ODD, integrating material from the
            existing TEI Guidelines, chiefly Chapter
            11. <title>Representation of Primary Sources</title> and
            Chapter 12. <title>Critical Apparatus</title>. It might
            eventually, at the end of the process described in the
            following section, constitute a self standing new
            <title>Guidelines</title> chapter, or remain a set of
            recommendations for how to customize the Guidelines, but
            that is a decision for the TEI Council.</p>
            <p>The document reflects  discussions held at a number of different
               meetings:</p>
            <list >

               <item>Workshop "Genetic Editions in a Digital Framework", held in Paris, 14/15 May
                  2009, and following discussion; programme of the workshop can be found here: <ptr

            <p>The working group has made a large use of the <title>HNML. HyperNietzsche Markup
                  Language</title> and following versions (<title>GML Genetic Markup
                  Language</title>) written by Paolo D'Iorio and collaborators for the
               HyperNietzsche project. We would like to thank Paolo D'Iorio for his invaluable
               contribution in the early stages of the work. </p>

	       <p>This latest draft of the document has been
	       extensively revised by Elena Pierazzo and Lou
	       Burnard, for discussion at the Genetic Editions
	       Workshop to be held in Wuerzburg in September 2009.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Work Plan</head>
               <p>The planned evolution of this document and the
	       encoding model it describes may be summarized as follows:</p>
               <list >
                  <item>Initially, we  worked on a pseudo-encoding
		  model, expressed using to our
                     own terminology. This stage was completed by July
		  2009. <!-- reference ? --></item>
                  <item>Subsequently, this pseudo-encoding model was
		  re-expressed using the TEI P5
                     encoding framework. 
		     The present document,
		     resulting from that work, once approved by the
		     working group, will be
                     presented at the TEI Members' Meeting 2009.</item>
                  <item>The same step-by-step approach will be taken for the standardisation
                     process: <list >
                        <item>First we develop an application profile, that is, a well-documented
                           TEI customisation.</item>
                        <item>This will be presented to the TEI Council as a proposed modification of
                           the TEI</item>
                        <item>If the TEI Council approves it, the Council will  decide how it
                           should be integrated into the current <title>Guidelines</title>.</item>
                     </list></item>
               </list>
<p>All versions of this draft document are publicly available for discussion and feedback
    from the community. The document source is maintained in the TEI
    subversion repository at <ptr
    target="http://tei.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tei/trunk/genetic/"/>; 
information about the development of the proposals and associated
materials, including complete drafts of this document, are hosted on the TEI Wiki at <ptr target="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Genetic_Editions"/>.

 <head>Conventions used</head>
 <p>Although the entire document is a draft and therefore susceptible of changes, some
    sections are less stable than others. In particular, when a section or a
    particular element requires further discussion or is considered an open problem,
    such a section or element is marked by a * mark.</p>
 <p>As required for TEI conformance, non-TEI elements are defined in a
 distinct non-TEI namespace. In the usage examples and throughout this document that namespace is mapped
 to the prefix <hi rend="bold"
       >ge:</hi>, while TEI elements are not marked by any namespace prefix.</p>

            <head>Theoretical Framework</head>
            <p>The genetic approach differs from other 
	    approaches to the study of texts
 because it aims not only to identify 'what is on the page', but also to reconstruct
 the <emph rend="bold">process</emph> necessary to produce 'what is on the page'.</p>
            <p>The encoding model for Genetic Editing must therefore
	    handle:-<list>
<item>Genetic <term>transcription</term> of a single document in such a
way as to trace its evolution; </item>
<item>Genetic <term>reconstruction</term>:  that is, creation of a  
    <term>Genetic Dossier</term> assembling multiple related
    documents, and description of the  genetic relations
 amongst them</item>
<item>Genetic <term>editing</term>, the goal of which is  preparation of a <term>Genetic Edition</term>
 whether derived from a single or multiple witnesses.</item>
</list>
A Genetic edition may be prepared either by producing a full
transcription of all extant witnesses, or by combining  a full
transcription of only one document (a <term>base-text</term>.) with information derived
from other witnesses by means of collation. </p>
            <p>Because our model aims to be independent of
	    presuppositions associated with  any particular
 theoretical framework, we begin by reviewing some typical dichotomies
 in editorial theory.</p>
            <div>
 <head>Fact vs. Interpretation</head>
 <p>In German editorial theory there is a well known opposition between what is there
    in the source document, the <term>record</term> (<foreign xml:lang="deu" rend="it">Befund</foreign>), and the
    interpretation of this phenomenon (<foreign xml:lang="deu" rend="it">Deutung</foreign>). This opposition
    implies that there is a way to talk about the record without any
    interpretation. Yet at some possibly simplistic level, everything we say about a text is
    based on interpretation, in the loosest sense of the word, in
    particular in the realm of genetic criticism.<note place="foot">See also the TEI’s
       (implicit) position on this point: <q>we define markup, or (synonymously)
          encoding, as any means of making explicit an <hi rend="italic"
             >interpretation</hi> of a text</q> (TEI Guidelines: <ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">v. A
          Gentle Introduction to XML</ref>). See also reference to Robinson and
       Solopova 1993/1997: 21: <q>Any primary textual source… has its own semiotic
          system within it.[…] The two semiotic system are materially distinct, in
          that text written by hand is not the same as the text on the computer
          screen</q>.</note> At the same time, 
    there is an obvious difference between the interpretation that some trace of
    ink is indeed a specific letter and the assumption that a change 
    in one line of a manuscript must have been made at the same time
    as a change in another line
    because their effects are textually related (for example, the
    first change was to a rhyming word, which necessitated the second change).
    Therefore we propose to talk about differing <term>levels</term>
    of interpretation, rather than insisting on a differentiation
between <soCalled>what’s there</soCalled> (document/fact) and
    <soCalled>how does it relate</soCalled> (text/interpretation).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
 <head>Document vs. Text</head>
 <p>In Manuscript Studies (Editing, Codicology, Palaeography, Art
    History, History) the first level of enquiry is always the document, the physical
    support that lies in front of the scholar’s eyes. </p>
 <p>To understand the text that is contained in the manuscript, a deep study of the
    manuscript itself is fundamental: the layout, the type of script, the type of
    writing support, the binding and many other aspects are able to tell us about
    when, where, and why this particular text was composed. The text therefore
    represents a second level of enquiry, not the first: it is a
    construct, derived from the reading of the documents.</p>
<p> In the case of modern draft
    manuscripts scholars must give detailed consideration to the layout, the different
    stratifications of writing and the disposition of these in the physical space; all
    of these, together with an understanding of the text, are required to gain
    insight about the composition, time of revisions, and flow
    (<foreign xml:lang="fr">flux</foreign>) of the text.
    Furthermore, in some cases,  we know that the kind of physical support used
    to record it not only influences but may also actually determine the text itself. For
    instance, the content and the length of letters  are often determined by the size
    and quantity of the paper available to the writer; even more so
for items such as postcards. </p>
 <p>The TEI has traditionally prioritised the text level. Of the two
 possible views
available to someone transcribing a primary source (text and
    document), the TEI privileges the text (hence <hi rend="italic">Text</hi> Encoding
    Initiative). Such physical or topographical information as a
    typical TEI encoding provides is subordinate to the main
    structural encoding, whether because it is represented by empty elements
       (<gi>pb/</gi>, <gi>lb/</gi>, <gi>cb/</gi>) or attributes (<gi>add
    place=""</gi>, <gi>note place=""</gi>, or <att>rend</att>). The
    TEI thus reflects the
not uncommon  view that, while relevant, documents are somehow less
relevant than the texts they embody; to use a bibliographical
    metaphor, texts are <soCalled>substantial</soCalled> while documents are
       <soCalled>accidental</soCalled>. </p>
 <p>However, for genetic editions a focus on the document is  crucial. In many cases, 
    the only way to reconstruct the process of writing and re-writing
    which leads to a new text is to examine a
    specific document. We therefore propose to complement the existing
    text-focussed approach with a new encoding
    scheme focussed instead on the document.</p>
 <p>We should then clarify the way we will use the following words:</p>
 <list >
    <item><label>Document</label> the physical object, the manuscript or other primary
       source</item>
    <item><label>Text</label> the content of the document, the words written in their
       logical (non physical) sequence</item>
    <item><label>Facsimile</label> a surrogate representation (non necessarily
       digital) of the document (a photograph, a microfilm, a digital image)</item>
    <item><label>Document level</label> transcription of the content of a document
       according to its physical layout</item>
    <item><label>Text level</label> transcription of the content of a document
       according to its logical, semantic meaning </item>
    <item><label>Text stage</label> a reconstructible and possible timed stage of
       evolution of a text, represented by a document or by a revision campaign within
       one or more documents. </item>
 </list>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Aspects of Genetic Editions</head>
            <p>Modern genetic editions encode the genetic process within one manuscript and over the
 course of two or more manuscripts; in this latter case quite often they also offer a
 view of each of the manuscripts as a single self-contained object. This is because
 the manuscript view provides the material basis for the relationships established by
 the inter-manuscript relationship. Therefore we propose to differentiate between the
 following aspects of a genetic edition:</p>
            <list >
 <item>
    <label>Document level</label>
    <list >
       <item>
          <label>The topological description</label> description of the layout of the
          text and the basis for a rendition of a text as a diplomatic
          transcription.</item>
       <item>
          <label>Textual Alterations</label> like additions, deletions,
          substitutions.</item>
       <item>
          <label>Grouping Modifications</label> groups of changes at different
          locations of one document, used to create sets which express the editorial
          assumption that these changes have been undertaken in one stage.</item>
    </list>
 </item>
 <item>
    <label>Dossier level</label>
    <list >
       <item>
          <label>Comparison</label> (Collation) expresses the differences between
          texts as the result of a comparison between documents.</item>
       <item>
          <label>Genetic Grouping</label> groups phenomena in more than one document,
          in order to describe editorial assumption that these phenomena are related
          in some way.</item>
       <item>
          <label>Genetic Relations</label> describes the genetic relation between
          different parts of a text,<note place="foot">As in the case where a document
             describes the ordering of parts of a text contained in another document.
             It is the case, for instance of Beckett's <title>That Time</title> where
             the speeches of A, B and C are obsessively first subdivided and
             subsequently shuffled and reshuffled by the means of sequences of letters
             and numbers contained in a number of documents.</note> and/or across
          several documents, as a series of steps on a path.</item>
    </list>
 </item>
 <item>
    <label>Document and Dossier levels</label>
    <list >
       <item>
          <label>Chronology, Date and Time</label> the encoding of the chronology of
          the text or parts of it in absolute or relative time.</item>
       <item>
          <label>Documenting Editorial Decisions</label> documents the arguments which
          are the basis for editorial decisions to encode the text in a specific way
          including ways to express uncertainty and alternatives.</item>

            </list>
            <div>
 <head>Document level</head>
 <div>
    <head>The Document-based Transcription </head>
    <p>The document-based transcription includes 4 hierarchically organised levels:
          <list >
          <item>Document<list >
  <item>Writing Surface (page, double page, folium, etc.) <list
        >
        <item>zone <list >
              <item>Line (or <gi>p</gi> or other block elements)</item>
           </list></item>
     </list></item>
             </list></item>
       </list></p>
    <p>We propose to introduce a new element, <gi>ge:document</gi> to encode a
       document-based transcription, at the same level  as  the existing
       TEI <gi>text</gi> element. A full TEI document may thus
       comprise:
<list>
<item>a TEI Header, containing metadata</item>
<item>a TEI <gi>facsimile</gi> element, containing and describing visual
representations of a document</item>
<item>a <gi>ge:document</gi> element, containing a genetic
transcription of a document</item>
<item>a TEI <gi>text</gi> element, containing an encoded version of
the text constructed from the document.</item>
</list>The header and at least one of the other three
    components must be present. We do not discuss <gi>facsimile</gi>
    or <gi>text</gi> elements here. </p>


<p>In the simplest case, a document contains
one or more written surfaces, of various types (pages, for example).
Each surface may contain one or more
distinct written zones of writing, each comprising one or more
identifiable topographic lines. The
following elements are used to represent these basic components:
<specList>
<specDesc key="document"/>
<specDesc key="surface" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="zone" atts="rotate stage"/>
<specDesc key="line"/>
</specList></p>


<p>Like a <gi>facsimile</gi>, a <gi>ge:document</gi> contains
information about the written surfaces constituting a
document. Because of this similarity, we propose using the same
elements (<gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi>) as proposed in the
existing TEI scheme, but with a small number of additional attributes
to support the specific needs of genetic editing. </p>


<p> The size of the writing surface is defined by a set of cartesian
       coordinates measured from the top left corner. The
       co-ordinates of all zones identified within the writing surface are
       given in terms of the same co-ordinates, as further discussed
       in the TEI proposals for <gi>facsimile</gi>. It will often be
       the case that explicit dimensions for a manuscript page
       (expressed in mm for example) are also supplied in a
       <gi>msDesc</gi> element in the TEI Header, but this is not a
       requirement.   </p>

    <p>A <gi>surface</gi> element may contain any number of
    <gi>zone</gi> <gi>graphic</gi> or <gi>line</gi> elements.
The <gi>graphic</gi> element is used to point to any graphic (non
textual) component included on the page, in the usual TEI manner. The
<gi>zone</gi> element is used to delimit any contiguous section of
writing which the encoder wishes to identify for some purpose. </p>

<p>Zones can be nested and grouped, and can also overlap.Their positioning with respect to the
          <gi>surface</gi> element is defined by coordinate values
	  taken from the same co-ordinate system as the surface itself, measured from
       the top left corner. The element carries a <att>rotate</att> attribute which
       describes (in degrees) the orientation of the surface with
       respect to  the
       content (writing, images) in that <gi>zone</gi>, with respect
       to its normal
       orientation. Note that the mechanism aims to describes
       the process by which the content of a specific <gi>zone</gi> has been supplied
       (i.e. the author has physically rotated the writing surface)
       rather than  the
       orientation of the writing.</p>
    <p>Zones are arbitrarily defined by the encoder according to the layout of the
       writing surface and can make use of a standardised vocabulary (e.g. the top
       margin). <!-- means what? --></p>
<p>The attribute <att>stage</att> is used to indicate the
<term>stage</term> in a writing campaign to which this zone has been
assigned by the 
encoder, as further discussed in <ptr target="#text-stage"/> below. 
</p>
<p>Within a zone, individual lines of writing are usually
distinguished using the <gi>ge:line</gi> element. </p>
    <p>In the following imaginary example, there are two main areas of writing, the diary
       entry (black ink) and another (supposedly later) annotation in blue ink. <figure>
          <graphic url="examples/D1.png"/>
       </figure> 
Note that the diary entry forms a zone which itself contains two zones: one containing
the date, and the other containing three lines about birds.  The
five lines of annotation in  blue ink form another zone, to record which the diary page has
       been rotated 90° clockwise by the author. Using the elements
       discussed so far, the page might be transcribed as
       follows:</p>

<p>For comparison, here is a typical TEI transcription of the same

    </egXML>
</p>
<p>Is it possible to combine both perspectives within a single
encoding? In general a document-based transcription, which is done page-by-page and possibly
       line-by-line, is almost certain to overlap with some part of a
the text-based structure. The cleanest solution may be to encode both
structures separately, providing both a <gi>document</gi> and a
distinct <gi>text</gi> solution, perhaps using some form of external
pointing to link the two, and minimizing redundancy of encoding by
using XInclude. This option is further discussed below and also in the
TEI Guidelines. </p>
<p>A further, and possibly simpler, approach is to apply to the
textual elements such as <gi>p</gi> exactly the same kind of
<soCalled>flattening</soCalled> approach as has been applied to the
<gi>line</gi> elements in the preceding example. Instead of marking
the textual paragraphs as full elements, we mark only their frontiers,
as follows:

</p>

<p>The written surfaces of which a document is composed are not always
homogenous. In the following example, taken from the Walt Whitman
archive, two pieces of newsprint have been glued to a piece of blue paper on which
a poem is being drafted:
<figure><graphic url="examples/whitman01.jpg"/>
<head rend="it">Image from http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/duk.00258.001.jpg</head></figure>
The two pieces of newsprint might perhaps be regarded as special kinds
of zone, but they are effectively new surfaces, since they might
contain additional written zones themselves (such as the numbers in
this case). We therefore propose a distinct element, <gi>patch</gi>,
which can appear within a <gi>surface</gi>, and behaves effectively
like one, except that it contains specialized attributes to provide
additional information.
<specList>
<specDesc key="patch" atts="binder type height width"/>
</specList>
Using this element, the Whitman draft above might be encoded as follows:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    <head>*Textual Alterations</head>
    <p>Traces of authorial alteration (correction, addition, deletion,
    etc.) are frequently found  within a single document, and may
    also be inferred when different documents are compared. It is
    however an open question
       as to whether inter-document  discrepancies at the dossier
       level should be regarded
       in the same way as intra-document alterations. If two 
       witnesses are collated, we may observe that a word present in
       one is missing from the other: does it necessarily follow that
       this is an addition or a deletion, which we would not hesitate
       to mark with an <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> tag if we are transcribing a
       single manuscript? We return to this question <ref
          target="#collation">below</ref>. <!--  Or do we need a completely new set of elements to do it? In
       a genetic process, at any point the author can decide to stop revising the text
       within a given document and decide to move to a new document (i.e. copy it
       anew), so the two phenomena (alterations at document level and alterations at
       dossier level) are indeed closely related. On the other hand we need to
       differentiate them because the one within a single document is explicitly
       marked by the author, while the one detected by comparison is only implicit. It
       may also happen that implicit alterations were perhaps marked in a lost
       intermediate version. This remains an open problem (see .</p>
    <p>The following discussion-->
    </p>
<p>In this section we discuss elements introduced for the markup of
alterations at the document level, within a single document,
complementary to the elements already provided for this purpose by
the TEI scheme. We discuss specifically:
<list>
<item><soCalled>meta-marks</soCalled>, that is a kind of markup in the source
indicating how it should be read; </item>
<item>additions, where a passage has been rewritten to fix or clarify
it; </item>
<item>deletions, where a passage had been struck through to indicate
that it has been, or where a deletion has itself been cancelled</item>
<item>transpositions, where passages have been reorganized or
resequenced; </item>
<item>sequencing of alterations. </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The TEI already provides the following basic elements for
transcription, which constitute the
<ident>model.pPart.transcriptional</ident> class:
<specList>
<specDesc key="add"/>
<specDesc key="app"/>
<specDesc key="corr"/>
<specDesc key="damage"/>
<specDesc key="del"/>
<specDesc key="orig"/>
<specDesc key="reg"/>
<specDesc key="restore"/>
<specDesc key="sic"/>
<specDesc key="supplied"/>
<specDesc key="unclear"/>
</specList>
<!--The present proposals extend this list by adding the following
elements to the same class:-->

</p>
    <div>
       <head>Additions and rewritings</head>
       <p>A writer may sometimes rewrite material a second time
       without significant change and in the same place. We
       consider this
 a distinct activity from addition as usually defined
       because no new textual material results but the status of existing
       material changes. We distinguish two variants of this: <term>fixation</term>
where the first version was a tentative draft which
       is subsequently fixed, for example by inking it over; and
       <term>clarification</term>, where the first version was
       badly written and has been rewritten for clarity.
The element <gi>ge:rewrite</gi> is provided to cover both cases.

<specList>
<specDesc key="rewrite"  atts="cause"/>
</specList>
       </p>

<p>In this simple example, taken from the papers of Henrik Ibsen, the
writer wrote the word  <mentioned>skuldren</mentioned> hastily,
and then returned to it to make  the letter <mentioned>l</mentioned> 
larger and clearer:
<figure><graphic url="examples/skuldren.jpg"/>
<head rend="it">Image from a ms of Peer Gynt, Collin 2869, 4°, I.1.1,
the Royal Library of Copenhagen</head>
</figure>
We might transcribe this word as follows:
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ge:line>...
Sku<ge:rewrite cause="unclear">l</ge:rewrite>dren
</ge:line>    </egXML>
</p>
<p>The following example, taken from a manuscript of Jane Austen's
<title>Sanditon</title>, shows a rewriting where a pencilled passage
has been fixed with ink, with some modification: 
<figure><graphic url="examples/AusSand70.png"/>
<head rend="it">Image from page 70 of the Sanditon manuscript</head>
</figure>
In this example, Austen sees in the fixation an opportunity to manipulate
     the text previously written, and thus changes the pencilled <mentioned>
could but get</mentioned> to the inked <mentioned>could
get</mentioned>. A simple  way of encoding this  might be
as follows:
     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <ge:rewrite cause="fixation" hand="ja2" seq="1">Now, if we
           could get 
           <del seq="1">but</del> a young Heiress</ge:rewrite>
     </egXML> 
</p><!-- this doesnt seem right though -->

<!-- Fixation can affect large potions of text, therefore it seems
     unpractical to transcribe the same text twice (as we would do in
     case we used <gi>add</gi>); furthermore it often happens that
     authors, while fixating a text, the decide to apply some
     modification on the underlying text. Therefore we need an element
     that imply a repetition (without providing it) and in the mean time
     is distinguished by <soCalled>real</soCalled> additions and for
     this reason we have introduced a <gi>ge:repetition</gi> element.
     See, for instance the following example of such a practise taken
     from page 70 of Jane austen's <title>Sanditon</title> (notice that
     the scope of such a fixation is of a page and a half):<figure>
        <graphic url="constr_example/AusSand70.png"/>
     </figure>
     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <ge:repetition type="fixation" hand="ja2" seq="1">Now, if we
           could get <subst seq="1">
              <del>but</del>
              <add status="duplicate">get</add>
           </subst>
           <del seq="1">get</del> a young Heiress</ge:repetition>
     </egXML> In the example, some corrections belong to the fixation
     stage, as. This fact has been marked via the
        <att>seq</att> attribute, assigning to all the alteration
     belonging to the repetition phase the same value (for the
        <att>seq</att> attribute, se <ref target="#seq"
     >below</ref>).</item>

     <label>Clarification</label> a word is badly written and the author
     rewrites it to clarify. In this case the TEI <gi>add
        status="duplicate"</gi> element could be used. An example of
     that can be see at <ptr
        target="http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html"/>, where the
     first example, where we have two lost chars overwritten by 'er',
     then overwritten again, could be encoded as follows: <egXML
        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <ge:line>Bæg<del>
              <gap extent="2" unit="chars"/>
           </del><add rend="overwritten" place="inline">er</add>
           <add status="duplicate" type="clarification" place="inline"
              >er</add>klang</ge:line>
     </egXML></item>
             </list></item>-->

<p>A single rewrite may not be sufficient, and it may  be that
the text becomes almost unreadable as a result of repeated
clarification. In the following example, for example, we can distinguish at
least two attempts to write the letters <mentioned>er</mentioned> in
the word <mentioned>bægerklang</mentioned>:

<figure><graphic url="examples/munch01.jpg"/>
<head rend="it">Image from http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html </head>
</figure>

We might encode this by nesting the <gi>rewrite</gi> element as follows:

     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ge:line>ved
        Bæg<ge:rewrite cause="clarify" stage="2">
	<ge:rewrite cause="clarify" stage="1">er</ge:rewrite></ge:rewrite>
...</ge:line>     </egXML> 

The <att>stage</att> attribute used here is discussed further below (<ptr target="#stages"/>).
<!-- maybe! -->

    <div>
       <head>Deletions</head>
       <p>In general deletion in a source is marked using the
       <gi>del</gi> or <gi>delSpan</gi> element. However, it is useful
       to distinguish cases where a passage has been <q>indicated as
       superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe,
       annotator, or corrector</q> (TEI P5, s.v. <gi>del</gi>) from cases
       where a passage has been struck through or otherwise marked as
       having been used or copied to another location. In this latter
       case, the author does not intend to suppress the content, but
       only to mark that it has been transferred or reused. The
       element <gi>ge:used</gi> is provided to mark this kind of
       <soCalled>deletion</soCalled>.</p>
<p>The following page from the Walt Whitman archive has been crossed
through to indicate used material:
<figure><graphic url="examples/whitman02.jpg"/><head>Page from 
http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/20051105_0650.jpg</head></figure>. This
page contains many deletions, which should be
distinguished from the deletion signalled by the large cross. Material
to be marked as reused generally spans more than one zone or
line. For that reason, the <gi>used</gi> element is a spanning
element, indicating the end of the used area by means of a
<att>spanTo</att> attribute. One way of encoding this page might thus
be:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <surface>
     <ge:used rend="cross" spanTo="#X2"/>
        <zone>

	</zone>  </surface>
             </egXML>
</p></div>


<div><head>Metamarks</head>
<p>By <term>metamark</term> we mean marks such as numbers, arrows, crosses, or
other symbols introduced by the writer into a document expressly for
the purpose of indicating how the text is to be read. Such marks thus
constitute a kind of markup of the document, rather than forming part of
the text. </p>
<p>Unlike marginal notes or
             other additions to the text, meta-marks
             indicate an deliberate alteration of the writing
	     (e.g. <q>move this passage over there</q>). We also
	     consider as metamarks dates introduced  to mark the
	     beginning of a manuscript or a revision, but not forming
	     part of it.</p>
<p>The <gi>metaMark</gi> element carries a
  <att>function</att> attribute which specifies the function of
             the meta-mark and a <att>targets</att> attribute which points to the
             element or elements concerned. </p>
<p>As an example, consider the manuscript of a poem by Emily Dickinson discussed by   Vetter and McDonald
2003 <note place="foot">
  <bibl>
     <author>Lara Vetter and Jarom McDonald</author>
     <title level="a">Witnessing Dickinson's Witnesses</title>
     <title level="j">Literary Linguistic Computing</title>
     <biblScope type="vol">18</biblScope>
     <biblScope type="issue">2</biblScope>
     <biblScope type="pp">151-165</biblScope>

     />
  </bibl>
             </note>. In this case, a plus sign is used to indicate that there are two
possible alternatives for the word following it, concerning which the
writer remains undecided. We can mark this up as follows: <egXML
  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<ge:line>        <ge:metaMark function="alternative" targets="#alt01">+<alt
              targets="#alt01 #alt02 #alt03" mode="excl" weights="1 0 0"
           /></ge:metaMark>
        <hi rend="underlined" xml:id="alt01">estranged</hi> -
           <ge:metaMark function="alternative" targets="#alt2"
           >+</ge:metaMark>
        <add type="alternative" xml:id="alt02" place="inline"
           >alarmed</add>
     </ge:line>
  <ge:line>
     <ge:metaMark function="alternative" targets="#alt03">+</ge:metaMark>
     <add type="alternative" xml:id="alt03">submerged</add> - </ge:line>
             </egXML> 
Note here the use of the existing TEI element <gi>alt</gi> to indicate
that the three elements indicated are mutually exclusive alternates:  the word
  <mentioned>estranged</mentioned> can be alternated with
  <mentioned>alarmed</mentioned> (written in-line, aster
  <mentioned>estranged</mentioned>) and <mentioned>submerged</mentioned>
             written at the bottom of the page. Since <mentioned>estranged</mentioned> is
             underlined, the editors argue  (loc cit pp. 155-162)
that  this possibility is to be preferred to the others and hence give it a
weight of 1.</p>
<p>Other examples of <gi>ge:metaMark</gi>
 can be
	     seen in marked-up proofs such as the following, taken
	     from the Walt
             Whitman archive: <ptr
  target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/loc.00295.jpg"
             />.
</p>    </div>
    <div>
       <head>Transpositions</head>
       <p>Metamarks are commonly used in the context of
       <term>transposition</term>, that is, the moving of words or blocks  by the author to a
          different position using arrows, asterisks or numbers or
	  other metamarks. One possible approach
          (used, for instance in HNML) would be to regard such
	  transpositions as a special kind of substitution, and
	  actually to represent the result of the transposition
	  indicated by the metamarksa in the encoding, for example by  consideribf the segment previous to the transposition as
          deleted, and substituted by the one after the transposition.
       </p>
<p>Our recommendation is to record the actual state of the witness, but
in such a way as to facilitate its reorganization as a distinct
processing step. Thus, we provide an additional element <gi>ge:tr</gi>
the function of which is to mark explicitly the section of text which
is to be transposed, and which carries an attribute <att>moveTo</att>
to indicate the location in the document to which it is to be
transposed. The presence and content of metamarks should  also be indicated,
where feasible.</p>
<!--

       <p>In the following simple example, taken from an Ibsen

<head>Extracted from <ptr target="http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html"/></head></figure>, the underlined numbers 1 and 2 indicate that,
       although the word <mentioned>bör</mentioned> precedes the word
       <mentioned>hör</mentioned> in the text, the order of the two words should be reversed. We
may encode this as follows:        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<ge:line>
<ge:tr xml:id="ib1" moveTo="#ib2">bör</ge:tr>

<p>An alternative approach to the use of the <att>moveTo</att>
attribute, is to represent the re-alignment of transposed blocks or
segments by means of a
          stand-off mechanism. The elements <gi>ge:transpositions</gi>
	  and <gi>ge:transposition</gi> are provided for this purpose.
Using these elements, the first example above might be encoded as follows:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <ge:line><ge:tr xml:id="ib01">bör</ge:tr><ge:metaMark rend="underline"

  <ge:transpositions>

        <ptr target="#ib01"/>

    <div>
       <head>*Substitution</head>
       <p>In the current model for the TEI <gi>subst</gi> element,
        one or more additions and deletions may be combined if they are
       considered as representing a single editorial act, a
       substitution. We propose that this model should be extended to
       include cases such as the following:  example taken from Thomas More's <title>Lalla Rooke</title>
          <figure>
             <graphic url="examples/moore01.png"/>
          </figure> 
Here the word <mentioned>pondering</mentioned> is deleted, and the
phrase <mentioned>she mus'd</mentioned> are added, while the word
<mentioned>thus</mentioned> remains unchanged. The most convenient way
of treating this all as a single substitution would be to modify the
content model of <gi>subst</gi> so as to permit text along with other
members of <ident
type="class">model.pPart.transcriptional</ident>. This would then permit an  encoding like the following: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <ge:line>While <ge:subst><del>pondering</del> thus <add>she

    <div>
       <head>Undoing alterations</head>
       <p>In some cases an author indicates that  an alteration is
       itself to be altered: for example, a struck through passage may be
          restored via a dotted underlining, or the underlining of a passage may be
          deleted by a wavy line. </p>
       <p>The TEI provides an  element <gi>restore</gi> for one
       specific kind of alteration to an alteration, namely the
       undoing of a deletion. We propose a more general element,
       <gi>undo</gi>.
<specList>
<specDesc key="undo"/>
</specList>
The element <gi>ge:undo</gi> usually encloses the
          element (e.g. the <gi>tr</gi>, <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>
	  etc.) to be undone. If it appears within such an element, the
	  implication is that only this part of the parent element has
	  been cancelled. For example, in this passage 
           taken from Giacomo Leopardi's <title>Zibaldone</title> (p.
          3595), the phrase <mentioned>si rechi á</mentioned> was
	  underlined word by word, and then the underlining of the
	  word <mentioned>si</mentioned> was cancelled. <figure>
             <graphic url="examples/leap01.png"/>
          </figure>This could be encoded as follows:<egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    <head>Stages</head>
    <p>A major purpose of genetic editing is the identification of <soCalled>campaigns of revision</soCalled>
       or <term>text-stages</term>). A genetic editor needs to be able
       to assign  a set of
       alterations (deletions, additions, substitutions,
       transpositions, etc.) to a text stage, to indicate both that
       one or more of such phenomena preceded or followed another and
       also to indicate that they are related in some way, for
       example that one is a consequence of the other. To document this we need:<list >
          <item>A system to attribute an alteration or any other phenomena occurring
             at document level to a particular revision campaign or text-stage</item>
          <item>A way to describe a revision campaign text-stage</item>
       </list></p>
<p>The present TEI element <gi>seq</gi> provides some of this
functionality, but not all. We propose the following mechanism. 
<list>
<item>a generally available attribute <att>stage</att> is provided
which can be used to identify any textual alteration as belonging to
some specific stage.</item>
<item>a <gi>stageList</gi> element is provided in the header, to group
together and document individual stages, each being defined by a
<gi>stageNote</gi> element. Typically, each <gi>stageNote</gi>  contains several
       references to <gi>ge:edJust</gi> elements (see <ref target="#edjust"
          >below</ref>) and to other annotations contained within the

    <p>In many cases it is necessary to scope a portion of text in which one or more
       alteration occurs, in order to give the necessary context for any editorial
       discussion. For that purpose we have introduced an element <gi>ge:mod</gi>,
       which occurs within a <gi>ge:line</gi> or a <gi>p</gi> or any block and phrasal
       level elements. As the element is likely to overlap with other hierarchies (in
       particular it is very likely to overlap with <gi>ge:line</gi> in case the
       editor has chosen to encode the document level), the element can also used as
       empty (provided it carries a <att>spanTo</att> attribute). <egXML

       <head>Timing</head>
       <p>Distinguishing instant correction from other kinds of alteration is
          important when establishing the timing of a specific revisions and in the
          whole genetic process. The information might be supplied as a specific
          attribute of <gi>add/</gi>, <gi>del/</gi>, <gi>subst</gi> etc., called
             <att>*timing</att> (or <att>*instant</att> or similar).<note place="foot"
  ><hi rend="bold">EP</hi>: I would avoid to use <att>type</att> as it
             my be useful for other things and I would rather prefer to have an
             attribute that express a temporal semantics.</note></p>
       <p>A specific subset of instant correction is represented by <hi rend="bold"
             >false starts</hi>, which are parts of a word that are overwritten by
          another (or struck through), meaning that the author started to write a
          word, then changed his/her mind and overwrote all or part of what was
          already written to fit the new word. This is an open problem: how to encode
          the partial word? Which is the scope of the correction? just the parts of
          the word that have been altered or all of it, even if this was not actually
          written? If it is possible to understand the word partially written, how
          should it be encoded? </p>
       <p> An example of false start can be seen in one of the many version of Walt
          Whitman's <title>The Sleepers</title> (available at <ptr
             target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/uva.00256.001.jpg"
          />) where the beginning of the third block could be encoded as follows:

          fragments, normally the beginning of a word (hence false <hi rend="italic"
             >start</hi>), so no encoding is provided to mark that the deletion
          affects a partial word. In case the editor is able and wishes to provide the
          unwritten missing part of the word (for searching or any other analytical
          purposes, for instance) the <gi xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
             >supplied</gi> element could be used, perhaps together with a
             <att>type</att> attribute (possibly redundant is already used for the

    the documents forming the dossier.</p>
 <p>It might be convenient to include documents within the dossier (corpus) via a

    <head>*Genetic Grouping </head>
    <p>Alterations, revisions and other compositional phenomena may need to be grouped
       at dossier level: it might in fact occur that authors correct two versions at a
          time,<note place="foot">Manzoni, for instance, used to modify an old draft
          to see how a new variant fitted with the context before copying it into a
          new draft.</note>or we might need to express that two or more documents are
       related in other ways; for instance, one can be the sequel of the other, they
       might have been drafted at the same time, or one might contain some other kind
       of analogy, like a newspaper article that inspired some kind of reflection
       contained in a given work. </p>
    <p>Such groupings can be encoded within a <gi>gi:geneticGrp</gi> element.<note
          place="foot"><hi rend="bold">EP</hi>: Sorry, but I don't like the name
             <gi>ge:textGroup</gi>, it is not clear enough. I appreciate we need a
          generic name, but we are not grouping texts, we are grouping: a) revisions;
          b) blocks (for instance when we want reorder chapters, as for Fotis' Kafka
          example; c) ???. I think <gi>ge:geneticGrp</gi> is clearer.</note> As the
       element <gi>ge:geneticGrp</gi> can be used more generally for any kind of
       genetic grouping, a <att>type</att> attribute is also provided.
          <gi>ge:geneticGrp</gi> contains a sequence of <gi xml:id="geneticNote"
          >ge:geneticNote</gi> whose <att>targets</att> attribute can refer to several
          <gi>ge:stageNote</gi> of specific documents or to other annotations and
       editorial statements.</p>
    <p>An example of Genetic Grouping can be considered the overview done by Kenneth
       Price and Brett Barney on the genesis of a Walt Whitman poem eventually titled
          <title>The Sleepers</title> which can be seen at <ptr
          target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/sleepers.html"/>.
       In this example we have 15 witnesses composed over 30 years, some of which
       contains just vague thematic resemblances with the poem (see witnesses 1-2, for
       instance), others are more strongly related.</p>
    <p>In this case we could create several kind of grouping, for instance: <list
          >
          <item>thematic: group texts that speak about night visions which the editors
             think are related to the poem</item>
          <item>evolutionary: group text for which the genetic connection is
             stronger</item>
          <item>type of document: group text that come form the same type of document
             (printed, notebook, etc.)</item>
       </list></p>
    <p>The first case could be encoded as follows: <egXML
          xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <profileDesc>
             <ge:geneticGrp>
  <ge:geneticNote type="thematic">
     <linkGrp>
        <link targets="#poem #sweet_flag"/>
     </linkGrp>
     <p>Groups the witnesses that contains ideas and suggestions that
        may have a connection to the poem</p>

    <head>Genetic Relations</head>
    <p>By <soCalled>genetic relations</soCalled> we mean the possibility of ordering
       different text-stages contained within a single document, or more probably,
       across different document into an ideal line of development, going, for
       instance from a version <hi rend="bold">A</hi> to a version <hi rend="bold"
          >B</hi> (that can be represented by a different document or by an
       editorially reconstructed text-stage), to a version <hi rend="bold">C</hi>,
       etc.</p>
    <p>While a <gi>ge:geneticNote</gi> would describe what a group of witnesses have
       in common, a genetic relation will try to align those witnesses in an ideal
       genetic/evolutionary line.</p>
    <p>To do so, we have adapted the concepts of <soCalled>node</soCalled>,
          <soCalled>arcs</soCalled> and <soCalled>graph</soCalled>.</p>
    <div>
       <head>Nodes and Arcs </head>
       <p>A node represent one version or a text that is somehow involved in the
          genetic process of a specific work; an arc connects two nodes (i.e. two
          version, two witnesses) and the set of the arcs generate a graph, i.e. the
          ideal line from the first to the last version of a work.</p>
       <list >
          <item>
             <gi>node</gi> represent a version of a text, or a text stage, or any
             related document. The element need to carry an <att>xml:id</att>
             attribute (to be used by arcs) and a <att>target</att> attribute which
             points to a file, in case of a document, or to a <gi>ge:stageNote</gi>, in
             case of a text stage.</item>
          <item>
             <gi>arc</gi> embeds a <att>rel</att> attribute which points to
             description of a specific type of relation as defined by a
  <gi>relation</gi> element (see <ref target="#genRel">below</ref>); an
             attribute <att>cert</att> signifies the degree of certainty associated
             with the interpretation; attribute <att>from</att> and <att>to</att>
             point to nodes, respectively to the beginning end ending points of the
             arc. Each <gi>arc</gi> element contains a <gi>label</gi> which give a
             title to the arc, and by an optional <gi>ge:edJust</gi>, which contains
             some sort of editorial statement about the arc. </item>
          <item>
             <gi>graph</gi> contains the full path from the first to the last version
             of a given work, in terms of a sequence of <gi>node</gi> and <gi>arc</gi>
             elements. A <gi>label</gi> element gives the title to the graph, while a
  <gi>ge:edJust</gi> element can be used to contain editorial statements
             about the constitution of a such path. </item>

     <p>The second notebook, "No doubt the efflux of the soul," is a
        longer one (24 leaves) that lays out the philosophical ideas
        that generate the poem and produces some of the key images in
        the first section of the poem ("Cache! And Cache again! All over
        the earth, and in the heavens that swathe the earth, and in the
        waters of the sea.—They do their jobs well; those journeymen
        divine. Only from the Poet they can hide nothing and would not
        if they could"). The key point here is that Whitman was

       <head>*Relationships</head>
       <p>The type of connections existing between two or more textual variants (an
          arc) or two or more steps (a graph) need to be declared and described in
          order to be used. For that purpose a slightly modified version of the
          element <gi xml:id="genRel">relation</gi> could be used within the
             <gi>profileDesc</gi>. A relation is defined in two ways: by a name
          (within a <att>name</att> attribute) and via attributes defining different
          properties, <note place="foot"><hi rend="bold">EP:</hi> Not sure how much to
             modify <gi>relation</gi>, Lou, I think this is worthy a
          disucssion</note></p>
       <p>Examples of relations are:<list >
             <item><label>Time</label> one document or textual version follows or
  precede another</item>
             <item><label>Evolutionary</label> one document or textual version
  represent the evolution or the development of another</item>
             <item><label>Thematic</label> two or more documents concern the same
  topic </item>
             <item><label>Conceptual</label> two or more documents are connected in
  some logical way</item>
          </list></p>
       <p>For the previous example relations could have been defined as follows:
             <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <profileDesc>
  <relation name="Thematic" xml:id="thematic">
     <desc>Relates witnesses that share themes and topic</desc>
  </relation>
  <relation name="Evolutionary" xml:id="evolution">
     <desc>Relates witnesses that are connected from a evolutionary
        point of view</desc>
  </relation>
             </profileDesc>
          </egXML>
       </p>
    </div>
 </div>
 <div xml:id="collation">
    <head>*Collation and Critical Apparatus</head>
    <p>As previously discussed (see <ref target="#alteration">above</ref>), at any
       time of the creation process the author can decide to stop editing a draft and
       move to another draft. Therefore alterations within a given document and
       alterations which result from the collation of different drafts of the same
       text are more conceptually connected than readings characterising different
       witnesses as a result of a scribal copy.</p>
    <p>For instance, if we have two draft documents of the same text, A and B, if a
       deletion occurs within A or B we would probably mark it with a <gi>del</gi>
       element. On the other hand, if when comparing A and B, we see a passage has
       been suppressed, we would also probably mark it as a deletion of some sort.</p>
    <p>At present the TEI uses an argument <foreign xml:lang="lat">e
          silentio</foreign>, meaning that is something is missing from a witness, the
       absence of the portion can be deducted by comparing different readings, but no
       element is used to qualify such absence. For instance comparing <title>Leaves
          of Grass</title>of the 1856 with the version of 1881-82at line 22 (of the
       1881-82 edition, see <ptr
          target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/sleepers.html"/>),
       we notice that some words have been added: <egXML
          xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions<app>
  <lem wit="#Leaves81-82">, all, all</lem>
  <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
             </app> sleep</l>
       </egXML>
    </p>
    <p>The usage of elements such <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> within a reading
       normally will mean that something has been added or deleted within that
       particular witness.</p>
    <p>The addition (or deletion) of a segment from a version is normally a deliberate
       act of the author and we would like to be able to record that in positive way;
       whether we need another set of editorial elements or we should use the same set
       that are used for transcription is still an open problem. </p>
    <p>For a critical genetic edition we can imagine at least two different
          scenarios:<list >
          <item>Only one document has been entirely transcribed (perhaps the first or
             the last version), while the others are only reconstructable via
             collation, which can be stored within the same document or in a separate
             one.</item>
          <item>All documents composing a dossier have been transcribed and the
             collation is stored in a separate document</item>
       </list></p>
    <div>
       <head>One document is transcribed</head>
       <p>If, beside the base-text which is fully transcribed, all extant witnesses
          have to be reconstructed via collation, it is mandatory to be able to
          distinguish alterations that happen within them and between witnesses. For
          instance, using the existing tag set we could possibly encode as follows:
             <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions<app>
     <lem wit="#Leaves81-82">
        <add>, all, all</add>
     </lem>
     <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
  </app> sleep</l>
          </egXML></p>
       <p>Nevertheless, this might force the intended usage of <gi>add</gi> as it
          might imply that there is an addition (interlinear, marginal or wherever) on
          the edition 1881-82 (a problem which will certainly be magnified with
          manuscripts) which is not the case. This might be solved perhaps using the
             <att xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">type</att> attribute or another
          attribute or creating a new element (say <gi>ge:interAdd</gi>) for addition
          implied by collation, reserving <gi>add</gi> for deletions that happen at
          the document level.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <head>All documents are transcribed</head>
       <p>In this case we can assume that all alterations occurring at document level
          are already encoded within each transcription, therefore the collation will
          only need to point to passages within the separate files and classify the
          types of readings resulting from the collation: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <app xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  <rdg wit="#Leaves81-82" from="#v22-5" to="#v22-8" type="added"/>
  <rdg wit="#Leaves56" from="#v22-5"/>
             </app>
          </egXML>
       </p>
       <p>The example encoding implies that attributes <att>from</att> and
             <att>to</att> are added to the <gi>rdg</gi> element.<note place="foot">I
             have not added those attributes as I think we have to discuss this
             further.</note></p>
    </div>
 </div>
            </div>
            <div>
 <head>Manuscript and Dossier Levels</head>
 <div>
    <head>Chronology, Date and Time</head>
    <p>Absolute time is the unambiguous reference to a calendar and time schema, while
       relative timing expresses events as happening <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
       and/or <hi rend="italic">after</hi> other events. Relative time can also be
       expressed by the relation to the (known or unknown) creation of another
       document or text. Dating can be justified by prose and/or by reference to a
       characteristic of a manuscript (e.g. hand, ink, etc.). The outlining of a
       chronology for a document or dossier can then be used as an argument to
       determine the existence of a text-stage.</p>
    <div>
       <head>Absolute Time</head>
       <p>For absolute timing we envisage two cases that can occur separately or in
          combination:</p>
       <list >
          <item>The dating of a witness (a manuscript part of a dossier) or of a
             division is not be directly documented within its content, i.e. it can be
             deduced from external facts and documents. The editorial date attribution
             should be included in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, within the
  <gi>creation</gi> element. </item>
          <item>Dates can be found in the document added by the author as a kind of
             metadata (for instance the date of the beginning/ending of writing on a
             specific document, or the date of a revision campaign); those should be
             encoded without necessarily adding them in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> (they
             can be considered a type of <hi rend="bold">meta-mark</hi>: see <ref
  target="#mm">below</ref>)</item>
       </list>
       <p>For expressing both cases we can use a slightly revised version of the
             <gi>timeline</gi> element. As we need to be able to express alternatives
          and uncertainty, the content model of <gi>timeline</gi> has been enlarged to
          accept a <gi>choice</gi> element; <gi>timelene</gi> can then also be used
          within <gi>choice</gi>. The <gi>when</gi> element has been modified to
          include editorial attributes like <att>cert</att>, <att>resp</att>,
             <att>evidence</att> and <att>source</att>, therefore in case of a date
          written in the manuscript by the author, like for Austen's
             <title>Persuasion</title>, we will have: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <when target="#pers-1" absolute="1816-07-08" evidence="internal"
  cert="high" source="#date-1"/>
          </egXML> Otherwise, in case of a conjectural date discussed in several parts
          of the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, we will have: <egXML
             xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <when target="#t2" absolute="1922" precision="low" evidence="conjecture"
  cert="medium" source="#inkanalysis"/>
          </egXML>
       </p>
       <p>As an example, let's consider again the analysis provided by Kenneth Price
          and Brett Barney on Whitman's <title>The Sleepers</title> (<ptr
             target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/sleepers.html"
          />), and let's assume that the order in which the witnesses are presented in
          the website is a chronological order; let's also assume that the chronology
          of two witnesses (the one titled <title>[become a shroud]</title> and the
          one titled <title>[I am a curse]</title>) is uncertain, the encoding could
          be as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
             <timeline origin="#poem" desc="dossier timeline">
  <when target="#poem"/>
  <when target="#sweet_flag"/>
  <when target="#curse1"/>
  <when target="#efflux"/>
  <choice>
     <timeline origin="#shroud" weights="0.8">
        <when target="#shroud"/>
        <when target="#curse2"/>
     </timeline>
     <timeline origin="#curse2" weights="0.8">
        <when target="#shroud"/>
        <when target="#curse2"/>
     </timeline>
  </choice>
  <when target="#topple_down"/>
  <when target="#black_lucifer"/>
  <!-- more -->
  <when target="#Leaves81-82" absolute="1881" evidence="internal"/>
             </timeline>
          </egXML>
       </p>
       <p>The example show how to order witnesses within a dossier, but the same model
          can be used to order text stages or variants within a section.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <head>Relative Time</head>
       <p>Relative time can be expressed in various ways: </p>
       <list >
          <item>In the easies case it might be a direct relationship: <att>next</att>,
  <att>previous</att>, <att>sync</att>, or as a “sorting” relationship:
  <att>before</att>, <att>after</att>.</item>
          <item>In some cases one may be able to express the relative timing of a
             section or a passage marked by the <gi>ge:mod</gi> element. This can be
             expressed via a numbering scheme (<val>0</val>, <val>1</val>,
  <val>2</val>, …) within a <att>seq</att> attribute. In this case we
             assume a <hi rend="bold">default</hi> time-line (the time of writing and
             of the <ref target="#instCor">instant corrections</ref>) which is
             represented by <val>0</val>, and successive revision-times (<val>1</val>,
  <val>2</val>, etc.)</item>
          <item>More complex situation could be expressed via the <gi>timeline</gi>
             element, as seen before. In this cases, when the attribute
  <att>absolute</att> is present, an absolute time is assumed, when
             absent, a relative time is assumed; in this way absolute and relative
             time can be used together. In case it is necessary to express
             simultaneity, the attributes <att>interval</att> and <gi>since</gi> could
             be used as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <when xml:id="t1" target="#poem"/>
  <when xml:id="t2" interval="0" since="#t1" target="#sweet_flag"/>
             </egXML>
          </item>
       </list>
       <p>Information about absolute or relative time can be given on all levels of a
          text or document. </p>
    </div>
 </div>
 <div>
    <head>Documenting Editorial Decisions</head>
    <p>As genetic editions and genetic editing are essentially interpretative,
       documenting editorial decisions has a fundamental role. </p>
    <p>Different forms of documentation have been discussed before in several previous
       sections: <list >
          <item><gi>ge:stageNote</gi>: documents the constitution of a text-stage (<ref
  target="#stageNote">see</ref>) </item>
          <item><gi>ge:geneticNote</gi>: documents the constitution of a genetic group
  (<ref target="#geneticNote">see</ref>)</item>
       </list>All these elements carry a <att>cert</att> attribute to declare the
       level of certainty, and a <att>resp</att> attribute to declare the editorial
       responsibility of an annotation; all of them should use <att>xml:id</att> to be
       pointed at from many places in the text.</p>
    <p>But annotations can also occur in-line (i.e. close to a textual fragment they
       relate to) and for that reasons we created the <gi xml:id="edjust"
          >ge:edJust</gi> global element. This should always be used with an
          <att>xml:id</att> attribute as the other types of annotations seen above are
       very likely to refer to specific points in the text within a more complex
       argument. The <att>target</att> attribute points to the element to be
       annotated, while a <att>cert</att> attribute indicates the level of confidence
       assigned to a specific editorial argument. <egXML
