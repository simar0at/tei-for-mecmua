            <head>About this Document</head>
            <p>This document contains the <hi rend="bold">draft</hi> of an encoding model for
               Genetic Editions and Genetic Editing. The document is the product of a Workgroup on
               Genetic Editions (chair: Fotis Jannidis), which is part of the TEI MS SIG (chairs:
               Elena Pierazzo, Malte Rehbein, Amanda Galley). </p>
            <p>The purpose of this workgroup is to try to elaborate an <hi rend="bold">Application
                  Profile</hi> able to encode genetic editions and, in general, genetic phenomena.
               The application profile will discuss how to use existing TEI elements in a genetic
               framework, presenting, where necessary, new elements and will take the form of a TEI
               extension. </p>
            <p>With respect to the <title>TEI P5 Guidelines</title>, the present document aims to
               integrate Chapter 11. <title>Representation of Primary Sources</title> and Chapter
               12. <title>Critical Apparatus</title>. It might be the case that it will, at the end
               of the process described in the following section, constitute a self standing new
                  <title>Guidelines</title> chapter, but this decision will be taken later on.</p>
            <p>The current state of this document reflects the discussion held in three different
               meetings:</p>
            <list type="bulleted">
               <item>MS SIG meeting held in London during the annual members’ TEI meeting (November
                  2008); the minutes of the meeting can be found here: <ptr

               <item>Workshop "Genetic Editions in a Digital Framework", held in Paris, 14/15 May
                  2009, and following discussion; programme of the workshop can be found here: <ptr

            <p>The working group has made a large use of the <title>HNML. HyperNietzsche Markup
                  Language</title> and following versions (<title>GML Genetic Markup
               Language</title>) written by Paolo D'Iorio and collaborators for the HyperNietzsche
               project. We would like to thank Paolo D'Iorio for his invaluable contribution in the
               early stages of the work. </p>

               <head>Methodology</head>
               <p>The stages we will follow to complete the present encoding model are the
                  following:</p>
               <list type="bulleted">
                  <item>Initially, we will work on a pseudo-encoding which is tightly bound to our
                     own terminology <hi rend="italic">[Stage completed on July 2009]</hi>.</item>
                  <item>In a second step we will try to map this pseudo-encoding to the actual TEI
                     encoding framework, in cooperation with Lou Burnard. The result will be
                     presented at TEI' Members Meeting 2009.</item>
                  <item>The same step-by-step approach will be taken for the standardisation
                     process: <list type="bulleted">
                        <item>First we develop an application profile, that is, a well-documented
                           TEI customisation.</item>
                        <item>This will be presented to te TEI Council as a proposed modification of
                           the TEI</item>
                        <item>If the TEI Council approves it, the Council will also decide how it
                           should be integrated into the current <title>Guidelines</title>.</item>
                     </list></item>
               </list>
               <p>All versions of the draft will be publicly available for discussions and feedback
                  from the community. Versions will be hosted on the TEI Wiki as PDF documents,
                  while the XML source will be stored in the TEI SVN repository.</p>

               <p>Although the entire document is a draft and therefore susceptible of changes, some
                  sections are less stable than others. In particular, when a section or a
                  particular element requires further discussion or is considered an open problem,
                  such a section or element is marked by a * mark.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Theoretical Framework</head>
            <p>The genetic approach differentiates from a more traditional text study approach
               because it is not only interested on 'what is on the page', but also to reconstruct
               the <hi rend="bold">process</hi> necessary to produce 'what is on the page'.</p>
            <p>The encoding model will present how to handle <hi rend="bold">Genetic
               Transcription</hi> (a transcription of a single document), how to reconstruct a <hi
                  rend="bold">Genetic Dossier</hi>, meaning how to describe genetic relations
               amongst multiple witnesses, and how to prepare a <hi rend="bold">Genetic Edition</hi>
               based on a single or multiple witnesses. In this latter case the model can be used
               both in the case of a full transcription of all extant witnesses, and in the case of
               the full transcription of only one base-text, with the others witnesses
               reconstructable via collation. </p>
            <p>The model aims to be independent of presuppositions made by any particular
               theoretical framework; therefore a couple of typical dichotomies in editorial theory
               have to be recognised and discussed.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Fact (or record) vs. Interpretation</head>
               <p>In German editorial theory there is a well known opposition between what is there
                  on the source document, the record (<foreign>Befund</foreign>), and the
                  interpretation of this phenomenon (<foreign>Deutung</foreign>). This seems to
                  imply that there is a way to talk about the record without any interpretation, but
                  this is certainly not entirely correct, because everything we say about a text is
                  based on interpretation (using a not very strict meaning of the word), in
                  particular in the realm of genetic criticism.<note place="foot">See also the TEI’s
                     (implicit) position on this point: <q>we define markup, or (synonymously)
                        encoding, as any means of making explicit an <hi rend="italic"
                           >interpretation</hi> of a text</q> (TEI Guidelines: <ref
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">v. A
                        Gentle Introduction to XML</ref>). See also reference to Robinson and
                     Solopova 1993/1997: 21: <q>Any primary textual source… has its own semiotic
                        system within it.[…] The two semiotic system are materially distinct, in
                        that text written by hand is not the same as the text on the computer
                     screen</q>.</note> On the other hand this truism cannot conceal the fact that
                  there is an obvious difference between the interpretation that some trace of ink
                  is indeed a specific letter and the assumption that a change in a manuscript at
                  the first line has been made at the same time as the change in the next line
                  because it adjusts the text to the new rhyme word introduced by the first change.
                  Therefore we propose to talk about differing levels of interpretation as we might
                  not be able to clearly differentiate between “what’s there” (document/fact) and
                  “how does it relate” (text/interpretation).</p>

            <div>
               <head>Document vs. Text</head>
               <p>In any branch of Manuscript Studies (Editing, Codicology, Palaeography, Art
                  History, History) the first level of enquiry is always the document, the physical
                  support that lies in front of the scholar’s eyes. </p>
               <p>To understand the text that is contained in the manuscript, a deep study of the
                  manuscript itself is fundamental: the layout, the type of script, the type of
                  writing support, the binding and many other aspects are able to tell us about
                  when, where and why this particular text was composed. The text therefore
                  represents the second level of enquiry, not the first. In the case of modern draft
                  manuscripts scholars must give detailed consideration to the layout, the different
                  stratifications of writing and the disposition of these in the physical space; all
                  of these, together with the understanding of the text, are required to gain
                  insight about the composition, time of revisions, and flow of the text.
                  Furthermore, for some kind of texts we know that the kind of physical support used
                  to record them not only influences but may actually determine the text itself. For
                  instance, the content and the length of letters are often determined by the size
                  and quantity of paper available to the writer. </p>
               <p>TEI’s approach prioritise the text level. Of the two possible main hierarchies
                  potentially available to someone transcribing a primary source (text and
                  document), the TEI privileges the text (hence <hi rend="italic">Text</hi> Encoding
                  Initiative) and relegates physical, topographical layout to empty elements
                     (<gi>pb/</gi>, <gi>lb/</gi>, <gi>cb/</gi>) or attributes (<gi>add
                  place=""</gi>, <gi>note place=""</gi>). The TEI does not say that documents are
                  not relevant, but that they are less relevant than texts; to use a bibliographical
                  metaphor, texts are <soCalled>substantial</soCalled> while documents are
                     <soCalled>accidental</soCalled>. </p>
               <p>For genetic editions the document level is indeed crucial as in many case it is
                  the only way to reconstruct the process of writing and re-writing contained by a
                  specific document. We therefore think that we should offer two possible encoding
                  approach: Document and Text.</p>
               <p>We should then clarify the way we will use the following words:</p>
               <list type="bulleted">
                  <item><label>Document</label> the physical object, the manuscript or other primary
                     source</item>
                  <item><label>Text</label> the content of the document, the words written in their
                     logical (non physical) sequence</item>
                  <item><label>Facsimile</label> a surrogate representation (non necessarily
                     digital) of the document (a photograph, a microfilm, a digital image)</item>
                  <item><label>Document level</label> transcription of the content of a document
                     according to its physical layout</item>
                  <item><label>Text level</label> transcription of the content of a document
                     according to its logical, semantic meaning </item>
                  <item><label>Text stage</label> a reconstructible and possible timed stage of
                     evolution of a text, represented by a document or by a revision campaign within
                     one or more documents. </item>
               </list>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Aspects of Genetic Editions</head>
            <p>Modern genetic editions encode the genetic process within one manuscript and over the
               course of two or more manuscripts; in this latter case quite often they also offer a
               view of each of the manuscripts as a single self-contained object. This is because
               the manuscript view provides the material basis for the relationships established by
               the inter-manuscript relationship. Therefore we propose to differentiate between the
               following aspects of a genetic edition:</p>
            <list type="bulleted">

                        of one document, used to create sets which express the editorial assumption
                        that these changes have been undertaken in one stage.</item>

                           the speeches of A, B and C are obsessively first subdivided and
                           subsequently shuffled and reshuffled by the means of sequences of letters

                     document-based transcription, as an alternative to <gi>text</gi>, and to use a
                     modified version of <gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi>.</p>
                  <p>A <gi>ge:document</gi> contains a sequence of <gi>surface</gi> elements. The
                        <gi>surface</gi> element has been added a <att>type</att> attribute which
                     suggested values are <val>page</val>, <val>leaf</val>, and similar. The
                     orientation of the writing surface is defined either by a set of cartesian
                     coordinates (measured from the top left corner) or implicitly stated by width
                     and height of the page recorded within <gi>msDesc</gi> (namely within
                        <gi>dimension</gi> or <gi>measure</gi> within <gi>objectDesc</gi>). </p>
                  <p>The <gi>surface</gi> element contains a sequence of <gi>zone</gi>s.
                     <gi>zone</gi>s can be nested and grouped, can overlap and have a sequence level
                     (i.e belong to a <ref target="#text-stage">text stage</ref>), expressed by the
                        <att>seq</att> attribute. Their positioning with respect to the
                     <gi>surface</gi> element is defined by cartesian coordinates, measured from the
                     top left corner. The element carries an <att>sOrientation</att> attribute which
                     describes (in degrees) the orientation that the surface has taken to enable the
                     content (writing, images) in that <gi>zone</gi>, with respect to the normal
                     orientation of the <gi>surface</gi>. Note that the mechanism aims to describes
                     the process by which the content of a specific <gi>zone</gi> has been supplied
                     (i.e. the author has physically rotate the writing surface) more that the
                     orientation of the writing.</p>
                  <p>Zones are arbitrarily defined by the editors according to the layout of the
                     writing surface and can make use of a standardised vocabulary (e.g. the top
                     margin). Their content can be: <list>
                        <item><gi>ge:line</gi>: a sequence of lines of text</item>
                        <item>a <gi>p</gi> or other block paragraph-like elements</item>
                        <item>a graphic/image </item>
                     </list></p>
                  <p>In the following we can easily detect two main areas of writing, the diary
                     entry (black ink) and another (supposedly later) annotation in blue ink. <figure>
                        <graphic url="constr_example/D1-thumb.png"/>
                     </figure>In order to add the annotation in the blue ink, the diary page has
                     been rotated 90° clockwise by the author. The page can be transcribed as
                     follows (transcription line by line):</p>

                     model.spanning which groups all elements that can be eventually spanned across

                     be empty. See the previous example encoded with spanned elements:</p>

                  <head>*Alterations</head>
                  <p>Alterations occurs within a single manuscript, but it is an open question
                     whether we can consider discrepancies amongst versions preserved by different
                     manuscripts (dossier level) also as a sort of <soCalled>alteration</soCalled>.
                     For instance, if by comparing (collating) two versions preserved by two
                     witnesses we note a word has been added or deleted, should we encode it, within
                     a collation, with <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> as we would when transcribing a
                     single manuscript? Or do we need a completely new set of elements to do it? In
                     a genetic process, at any point the author can decide to stop revising the text
                     within a given document and decide to move to a new document (i.e. copy it
                     anew), so the two phenomena (alterations at document level and alterations at
                     dossier level) are indeed closely related. On the other hand we need to
                     differentiate them because the one within a single document is explicitly
                     marked by the author, while the one detected by comparison is only implicit. It
                     may also happen that implicit alterations were perhaps marked in a lost
                     intermediate version. This remains an open problem (see <ref
                        target="#collation">also</ref>).</p>
                  <p>The following discussion relates to the alterations at document level: for a
                     discussion of their use at dossier level also <ref target="#collation"

                     <p>Beside “normal” additions (see for instance the TEI definition of the
                           <gi>add</gi> element: <q>contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in
                           the text by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</q>), we have
                        outlined some other special kinds of additions, where text is added to the
                        document but not to the text:</p>

                              <gi>ge:repetition</gi> element. Repetitions can be of two main
                              types:<list type="bulleted">
                              <item>
                                 <label>Fixation</label> which results from authors fixing a text
                                 passage by overwriting it (e.g. a pencilled passage fixed with
                                 ink). <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"

                        deleted, or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text
                        by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.”), we have outlined some
                        other special kinds of deletion: </p>
                     <list type="bulleted">
                        <item><label>Marked as used</label> passages that happen to be struck
                           through, where the strike marks the passage as used/copied at another
                           location/another manuscript. In this case the author does not intend to
                           suppress the content, but only to mark that it has been transferred or
                           reused. We have created the <gi>ge:used</gi> element for this purpose. As
                           the portions that are marked as used are normally full pages or large
                           portions of pages, <gi>ge:used</gi> can contains <gi>zones</gi> or can be used within them.

                        deleted, and substituted by the one after the transposition) but this will
                        not work for transposition of blocks. </p>

                     <p>Distinguishing instant correction from other kinds of alteration is
                        important when establishing the timing of a specific revisions and in the

                     <p>A specific subset of instant correction is represented by <hi rend="bold"

                        another (or struck through), meaning that the author started to write a
                        word, then changed his/her mind and overwrote all or part of what was
                        already written to fit the new word. This is an open problem: how to encode
                        the partial word? Which is the scope of the correction? just the parts of
                        the word that have been altered or all of it, even if this was not actually
                        written? If it is possible to understand the word partially written, how
                        should it be encoded? Will <gi>supplied</gi> a good candidate for that?

                     <p>In some case authors undo alterations, e.g. a struck through passage may be
                        restored via a dotted underlining, or the underlining of a passage may be
                        deleted by a wavy line. </p>
                     <p>An element <gi>restore</gi> already exists in TEI for undoing a deletion,
                        but we need a more general approach, for instance to delete underlining or
                        transposition. We have introduced an element <gi>ge:undo</gi> for that
                        purpose provided with at attribute <att>target</att> pointing at the element
                        to be undone: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     time, etc.). To document this we need:<list type="bulleted">
                        <item>A system to attribute an alteration or any other phenomena occurring
                           at document level to a particular revision campaign/text-stage</item>

                     </list></p>
                  <p>For the former purpose ('attribute an alteration to a revision campaign') we
                     have introduced a global attribute <att>rev</att> that points to an
                     <att>xml:id</att> attribute within an element describing a specific text-stage;
                     the element provided for that purpose is <gi>ge:revDesc</gi> which can occur
                     within the <gi>teiHeader</gi> and groups the editorial reasons for stating that
                     some alteration belong to a text-stage. Element <gi>ge:revDesc</gi> contains a
                     sequence of <gi xml:id="revNote">ge:revNote</gi>, each of them describing a
                     single text-stage. Typically, a <gi>ge:revNote</gi> will contain several
                     references to <gi>ge:edJust</gi> elements (see <ref target="#edjust"
                     >below</ref>) and to other annotations contained within the <gi>teiHeader</gi>.</p>
                  <p>In many cases it is necessary to scope a portion of text in which one or more
                     alteration occurs, in order to give the necessary context for any editorial
                     discussion. For that purpose we have introduced an element
                     <gi>ge:revision</gi>, which occurs within a <gi>ge:line</gi> or a <gi>p</gi> or
                     any block and phrasal level elements. As the element is likely to overlap with
                     other hierarchies (in particular it is very likely to overlap with
                     <gi>ge:line</gi> in case the editor has chosen to encode the document level),
                     we also provide a <gi>ge:revSpan/</gi> empty element.</p>

         spatially disparate changes. </p>-->
                  <p>Alterations, revisions and other compositional phenomena may need to be grouped
                     at dossier level: it might in fact occur that authors correct two versions at a

                        to see how a new variant fitted with the context before copying it into a

                     related in other ways; for instance, one can be the sequel of the other, they
                     might have been drafted at the same time, or one might contain some other kind
                     of analogy, like a newspaper article that inspired some kind of reflection
                     contained in a given work. </p>

                  <p>As previously discussed (<ref target="#altrations">see</ref>), the moment at
                     which the author decides to stop editing a draft and moves to another draft is
                     arbitrary. Therefore alterations within a given document and alterations which
                     result from the collation of different drafts of the same text are more
                     conceptually connected than readings characterising different witnesses as a
                     result of a scribal copy.</p>
                  <p>For instance, if we have two draft documents of the same text, A and B, if a
                     deletion occurs within A or B we would probably mark it with a <gi>del</gi>
                     element. On the other hand, if when comparing A and B, we see a passage has
                     been suppressed, we would also probably mark it as such. Whether we need
                     another set of editorial elements or we should use the same set that are used
                     for transcription is still an open problem. </p>
                  <p>We can imagine at least two different scenarios:<list type="bulleted">
                        <item>Only one document has been entirely transcribed (perhaps the first or
                           the last version), while the others are only reconstructable via
                           collation, which can be stored within the same document or in a separate
                           one.</item>
                        <item>All documents composing a dossier have been transcribed and the
                           collation is stored in a separate document</item>
                     </list></p>
                  <div>
                     <head>One document is transcribed</head>
                     <p>If, beside the base-text which is fully transcribed, all extant witnesses
                        have to be reconstructed via collation, it is mandatory to be able to
                        distinguish alterations that happen within them and between witnesses. For
                        instance, using the existing tag set we could possibly encode as follows:
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                           <app xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
                              <rdg wit="#A" xml:id="rdg1">here is a passage in A</rdg>
                              <rdg wit="#B">
                                 <del>
                                    <ptr target="#A #rdg1"/>
                                 </del>
                              </rdg>
                           </app>
                        </egXML></p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, this might force the intended usage of <gi>del</gi> and might
                        imply that there is a deletion on B, which is not the case. This might be
                        solved perhaps using the <att xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">type</att>
                        attribute or another attribute or creating a new element (say
                           <gi>ge:interDel</gi>) for deletions implied by collation, reserving
                           <gi>del</gi> for deletions that happen at the document level.</p>

                        are already encoded within each transcription, therefore the collation will
                        only need to point to passages within the separate files and classify the
                        types of readings resulting from the collation: <egXML
                           xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     other events. Relative time can also be expressed by the relation to the (known
                     or unknown) creation of another document or text. Dating can be justified by
                     prose and/or by reference to a characteristic of a manuscript (e.g. hand, ink,
                     etc.). The outlining of a chronology for a document or dossier can then be used
                     as an argument to determine the existence of a text-stage.</p>

                  <p>As genetic editions and genetic editing are essentially interpretative,
                     documenting editorial decisions has a fundamental role. </p>
                  <p>Different forms of documentation have been discussed before in several previous
                     sections: <list type="bulleted">

                     </list>All these elements carry a <att>cert</att> attribute to declare the
                     level of certainty; all of them shoulduse <att>xml:id</att> to be pointed at

                        always have a @resp attribute</note></p>
                  <p>But annotations can also occur in-line (i.e. close to a textual fragment they
                     relate to) and for that reasons we created the <gi xml:id="edjust"
                     >ge:edJust</gi> global element. This should always be used with an
                     <att>xml:id</att> attribute as the other types of annotations seen above are
                     very likely to refer to specific points in the text within a more complex
                     argument n. The <att>target</att> attribute points to the element to be
                     annotated, while the <att>locus</att> attribute points to the concept to be
                     justified. <note place="foot">LB: ?????</note><egXML
