            <head>About this Document</head>
            <p>This document describes a <hi rend="bold">draft</hi> encoding model for Genetic
               Editions and Genetic Editing. The document is the product of a Workgroup on Genetic
               Editions (chair: Fotis Jannidis), which is part of the TEI MS SIG (chairs: Elena
               Pierazzo, Malte Rehbein, Amanda Galley). </p>
            <p>The workgroup's goal was to develop an Application Profile for the encoding of
               genetic editions and, in general, genetic phenomena. It is expressed as a TEI P5
               conformant customization, integrating material from the existing TEI Guidelines,
               chiefly Chapter 11. <title>Representation of Primary Sources</title> and Chapter 12.
                  <title>Critical Apparatus</title>, together with additional new material. It may
               eventually, at the end of the process described in the following section, constitute
               a free-standing new chapter of the <title>Guidelines</title> or remain a set of
               recommendations for how to customize the Guidelines, but that is a decision for the
               TEI Council.</p>
            <p>The document reflects discussions held at a number of different meetings:</p>
            <list>
               <item>MS SIG meeting held in London during the annual members’ TEI meeting (November
                  2008); the minutes of the meeting can be found here: <ptr

               <item>Workshop "Genetic Editions in a Digital Framework", held in Paris, 14/15 May
                  2009, and following discussion; programme of the workshop can be found here: <ptr

               <item>Genetic Edition workgroup held in Würzburg (September 2009)</item>
            </list>
<p>The document was subsequently extensively revised by Elena Pierazzo and Lou Burnard, for
                  presentation at a panel held at the Annual TEI Members Meeting in November
                  2009; at a 
               Genetic Edition workgroup held in Oxford (February
	       2010); at a Genetic Edition workgroup held in Würzburg
	       (March 2010); and finally in Oxford in April of the
	       same year for
	       presentation to the TEI Council meeting in Dublin.</p>
            <p>The work group was initially inspired by HMNL, the 
	    <soCalled>HyperNietzsche Markup
                  Language</soCalled> and following versions (<title>GML Genetic Markup
                  Language</title>) produced by Paolo D'Iorio and colleagues from the HyperNietzsche
               project. We would like to thank Paolo D'Iorio for his invaluable contribution in the
               early stages of the work. </p>
<p>Major contributors to this document, in addition to those already
cited, include Gregor Middel and Moritz Wissenbach, from the
Faustprojekt at the University of Wuerzburg. </p>

               <head>Work Plan</head>
               <p>The planned evolution of this document and the encoding model it describes may be
                  summarized as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Initially, we worked on a pseudo-encoding model, expressed using our own
                     terminology. This stage was completed by July 2009. <!-- reference ? --></item>
                  <item>This pseudo-encoding model was re-expressed using the TEI P5 encoding
                     framework and revised extensively. </item>
                  <item>The same step-by-step approach will be taken for the standardisation
                     process: <list>
                        <item>First we develop an application profile, that is, a well-documented
                           TEI customisation.</item>
                        <item>This will be presented to the TEI Council as a proposed modification
                           of the TEI</item>
                        <item>If the TEI Council approves it, the Council will decide how it should
                           be integrated into the current <title>Guidelines</title>.</item>

                  materials, is hosted on the TEI Wiki at <ptr

               <head>Conventions used</head>
               <p>Although the entire document is a draft and therefore susceptible of changes, some
                  sections are less stable than others. In particular, when a section or a
                  particular element requires further discussion or is considered an open problem,
                  such a section or element is marked by a * mark.</p>
               <p>As required for TEI conformance, non-TEI elements are defined in a distinct
                  non-TEI namespace. In the usage examples and throughout this document that
                  namespace is mapped to the prefix <hi rend="bold">ge:</hi>, while TEI elements are
                  not marked by any namespace prefix.</p>

            <head>Theoretical Framework</head>
            <p>The genetic approach differs from other approaches to the study of texts because it
               aims not only to identify <q>what is on the page</q>, but also to reconstruct the
                  <emph rend="bold">process</emph> necessary to produce <q>what is on the
               page</q>.</p>
            <p>The encoding model for Genetic Editing must therefore handle:- <list>
                  <item>Genetic <term>transcription</term> of a single document in such a way as to
                     trace its evolution; </item>
                  <item>Genetic <term>reconstruction</term>: that is, creation of a <term>Genetic
                        Dossier</term> assembling multiple related documents, and description of the
                     genetic relations amongst them;</item>
                  <item>Genetic <term>editing</term>, the goal of which is preparation of a
                        <term>Genetic Edition</term> whether derived from a single or multiple
                     witnesses.</item>
               </list> A Genetic Edition may be prepared by producing a full transcription of all
               extant witnesses, or by combining a full transcription of only one document (a
                  <term>base-text</term>) with information derived from other witnesses by means of
               automatic collation.</p>
            <p>Because our model aims to be independent of presuppositions associated with any
               particular theoretical framework, we begin by reviewing some typical dichotomies in
               editorial theory.</p>
            <div xml:id="deutung">
               <head>Fact vs. Interpretation</head>
               <p>In German editorial theory there is a well known opposition between what is there
                  in the source document, the <term>record</term> (<foreign xml:lang="deu" rend="it"
                     >Befund</foreign>), and the interpretation of this phenomenon (<foreign
                     xml:lang="deu" rend="it">Deutung</foreign>). This opposition implies that there
                  is a way to talk about the record without any interpretation. Yet at some possibly
                  simplistic level, everything we say about a text is based on interpretation,
                  particularly in the realm of genetic criticism.<note place="foot">See also the
                  TEI’s (implicit) position on this point: <q>we define markup, or (synonymously)
                        encoding, as any means of making explicit an <hi rend="italic"
                           >interpretation</hi> of a text</q> (TEI Guidelines: <ref
                        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">v. A
                        Gentle Introduction to XML</ref>). See also reference to Robinson and
                     Solopova 1993/1997: 21: <q>Any primary textual source… has its own semiotic
                        system within it.[…] The two semiotic system are materially distinct, in
                        that text written by hand is not the same as the text on the computer
                        screen</q>.</note> At the same time, there is an obvious difference between
                  the interpretation that some trace of ink is indeed a specific letter and the
                  assumption that a change in one line of a manuscript must have been made at the
                  same time as a change in another line because their effects are textually related
                  (for example, the first change was to a rhyming word, which necessitated the
                  second change). Therefore we propose to talk about differing <term>levels</term>
                  of interpretation, thus differentiating between <soCalled>what’s there</soCalled>
                  (document/fact) and <soCalled>how does it relate</soCalled>
                  (text/interpretation).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Status vs. Process</head>
               <p>When a scholar examines a written text, especially a manuscript, the object of the
                  investigation is usually to discover the final result of that writing and
                  rewriting process. The examination can take various forms: it can be approached
                  from a codicological or documentary point of view, <soCalled>photographing</soCalled> the resulting
                  product, from a textual point of view, or from a genetic point of view, by trying
                  to describe the flow of authoring.</p>
               <p>The present proposal addresses both approaches: sections <ptr target="#document"/>
                  and <ptr target="#alterations"/> are presented from
		  the codicological or documentary point of view,
                  while the other sections investigate the process of writing and re-writing of the
                  text, thus constituting the purely genetic parts of the present proposal.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Document vs. Text</head>
               <p>In Manuscript Studies (Editing, Codicology, Palaeography, Art History, History)
                  the first level of enquiry is always the document, the physical support that lies
                  in front of the scholar’s eyes. </p>
               <p>To understand the text that is contained in the manuscript, a deep study of the
                  manuscript itself is fundamental: the layout, the type of script, the type of
                  support, the binding, and many other aspects are able to tell us about
                  when, where, and why this particular text was composed. The text however
                  represents a different level of enquiry: it is a construct, derived from the
                  reading of the documents.</p>
               <p>In the case of modern draft manuscripts scholars must give detailed consideration
                  to the layout, the different stratifications of writing and the disposition of
                  these in the physical space; all of these, together with an understanding of the
                  text, are required to gain insight about the composition, time of revisions, and
                  flow (<foreign xml:lang="fr">flux</foreign>) of the text. Furthermore, in some
                  cases, we know that the kind of physical support used to record it not only
                  influences but may also actually determine the text itself. For instance, the
                  content and the length of letters are often determined by the size and quantity of
                  the paper available to the writer; even more so for items such as postcards. </p>
               <p>The TEI has traditionally prioritised the text level. Of the two possible views
                  available to someone transcribing a primary source (text and document), the TEI
                  privileges the text (hence <hi rend="italic">Text</hi> Encoding Initiative). Such
                  physical or topographical information as a typical TEI encoding provides is
                  subordinate to the main structural encoding, whether because it is represented by
                  empty elements (<gi>pb/</gi>, <gi>lb/</gi>, <gi>cb/</gi>) or attributes (<gi>add
                     place=""</gi>, <gi>note place=""</gi>, or <att>rend</att>). The TEI thus
                  reflects the not uncommon view that, while relevant, documents are somehow less
                  relevant than the texts they embody; to use a bibliographical metaphor, texts are
                     <soCalled>substantial</soCalled> while documents are
                     <soCalled>accidental</soCalled>. </p>
               <p>However, for genetic editions, a focus on the document is crucial. In
                  many cases, the only way to reconstruct the process of writing and re-writing
                  which leads to a new text is to examine a specific document. We therefore propose
                  to complement the existing text-focussed approach with a new encoding scheme
                  focussed instead on the document.</p>
               <p>We should then clarify the way we will use the following words:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><label>Document</label> the physical object, the manuscript or other primary
                     source, comprising one or more written surfaces</item>
                  <item><label>Text</label> the intellectual content of the document, the words
                     written in their logical (non physical) sequence</item>
                  <item><label>Facsimile</label> a surrogate representation (not necessarily
                     digital) of the document (a photograph, a microfilm, a digital image)</item>
                  <item><label>Document level</label> transcription of the content of a document
                     according to its physical layout</item>

               <head>Writing Acts vs. Text Stages</head>
               <p>As noted in the previous section, the focus on purely
	       documentary aspects in a genetic edition often serves to reconstruct the writing
                  process, which in turn enables allow the editor to justify a genetic analysis,
                  for example to identify which text passage has been altered first or which textual variant predates
                  another. The encoding of the writing process, it
		  must be observed, is not simply a different point of
		  view about the text in hand, but rather regards as a
		  relevant a set of
	       information fundamentally different from that
	       captured by a purely textual encoding.</p>
               <p>When talking about alterations on a textual level,
	       it is
	       the <emph>stages</emph> of the text which vare of major
	       interest. These stages are the results of various alterations
                  applied to the draft; each addition, deletion, substitution etc. is viewed from the perspective
                  of the possibly new text state it yields. For example the following substitution is
                  well-defined from this perspective:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <subst>
                     <del>landscape</del>
                     <add>scenery</add>
                  </subst>
               </egXML>
               <p>When considering the  writing process however, a
	       number of different possible writing acts can
                  be imagined leading to the same change of state. For
		  example: <egXML
                     xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <p>
                        <del rend="strikethrough">landsca</del>pe <handShift new="#new_material"
                        />scenery </p>
                  </egXML>
               </p>
               <p>This example stresses the writing process and
	       provides two additional pieces of information: firstly
	       the fact that the author did not strike through the
	       whole of the first word and secondly that
                  a change in writing material happened just before
		  the word <mentioned>scenery</mentioned> was written.
                  In current encoding practice, which tends to favour the textual view, the two
                  perspectives are often integrated, subordinating aspects of the writing process to
                  their textual outcome  or regularizing them so they do not interfere with
                  a text-driven evaluation of the encoding.</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <subst>
                     <del><hi rend="strikethrough">landsca</hi>pe</del>
                     <add hand="#new_material">scenery</add>
                  </subst>
               </egXML>
               <p>As the example shows, this integrative approach can be a viable one in many cases,
                  but taking this pragmatic shortcut  blurs a specific editorial
                  distinction, maybe exactly the distinction one wants to emphasize (e.g. to
                  separate <foreign>Befund</foreign> from
		  <foreign>Deutung</foreign>). Furthermore, it makes it particularly hard to be as precise about the
                     <emph>documentation</emph> of <soCalled>what’s
		     there</soCalled> as one is about the
                     <emph>interpretation</emph> of <soCalled>what’s the possible outcome</soCalled>. Ideally in a
                  genetic edition the editor would prefer to encode the two perspectives
                  separately and align them later on instead of trying to integrate them right away,
                  and thereby potentially neglect  information of
	       importance in their genetic analysis.</p>

            <head>Aspects of Genetic Editions</head>
            <p>Modern genetic editions describe the genetic process within one manuscript and over
               the course of two or more manuscripts, which are said to form part of a
                  <term>dossier</term>, that is, the set of documents which a genetic editor
               considers as having contributed to the evolution of a particular text, including
               associated diaries, letters, etc. Usually a view of a manuscript as a single
               self-contained object is also offered. This is because the manuscript view provides
               the material basis for the relationships established by the inter-manuscript
               relationship. Therefore we propose to differentiate between the following aspects of
               a genetic edition:</p>

                     <item>a TEI Header, containing metadata</item>
                     <item>a TEI <gi>facsimile</gi> element, containing and describing visual

                     <item>a TEI <gi>text</gi> element, containing an encoded version of the text
                        constructed from the document.</item>
                  </list>The header and at least one of the other three components must be present.
                  We do not discuss <gi>facsimile</gi> or <gi>text</gi> elements here; for these
                  refer to the published TEI Guidelines. </p>
               <p>In the simplest case, a document contains one or more written surfaces, of various
                  types (pages, for example). Each surface may contain one or more distinct written
                  zones of writing, each comprising one or more identifiable topographic lines. The
                  following elements are used to represent these basic components: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="document"/>
                     <specDesc key="surface" atts="type"/>

               <p>Like a <gi>facsimile</gi>, a <gi>ge:document</gi> contains information about the
                  written surfaces constituting a document. Because of this similarity, we would
                  like to use the same elements (<gi>surface</gi> and <gi>zone</gi>) as proposed in
                  the existing TEI scheme, although these place limits on what can be described.
                  Specifically, the <gi>zone</gi> element as currently defined can represent only a
                  rectangular area; it also lacks any way of stating the baseline applicable to any
                  writing contained within it </p>
               <p>The size of the writing surface is defined by a set of cartesian coordinates
                  measured from the top left corner. The co-ordinates of all zones identified within
                  the writing surface are given in terms of the same co-ordinates, as further
                  discussed in the TEI proposals for <gi>facsimile</gi>. It will often be the case
                  that explicit dimensions for a manuscript page (expressed in mm for example) are
                  also supplied in a <gi>msDesc</gi> element in the TEI Header, but this is not a
                  requirement; in particular there is no assumption that the co-ordinate system
                  defined by a <gi>surface</gi> maps to any particular external dimensions, nor that
                  the co-ordinate systems of different documents necessarily correspond. </p>
               <p>A <gi>surface</gi> element may contain any number of <gi>zone</gi>,
                     <gi>graphic</gi>, <gi>ge:line</gi> or <gi>table</gi>elements. The
                     <gi>graphic</gi> element is used to point to any graphic (non textual)
                  component forming part of the page, in the usual TEI manner. The <gi>zone</gi>
                  element is used to delimit any contiguous section of writing which the encoder
                  wishes to identify for some purpose. </p>
               <p>Zones can be nested and grouped, and can also overlap. Their positioning with
                  respect to the <gi>surface</gi> element is defined by coordinate values taken from
                  the same co-ordinate system as the surface itself, measured from the top left
                  corner. The element carries a <att>rotate</att> attribute which describes (in
                  degrees) the orientation of the surface with respect to the content (writing,
                  images) in that <gi>zone</gi>, with respect to its normal orientation. Note that
                  the mechanism aims to describes the process by which the content of a specific
                     <gi>zone</gi> has been supplied (i.e. the author has physically rotated the
                  writing surface) rather than the orientation of the writing.</p>
               <!-- fotis wants to generalise rotation to things other than zones 
actually he wants to kill it... -->
               <p>Zones are arbitrarily defined by the encoder according to the layout of the
                  writing surface and can make use of a standardised vocabulary (e.g. the top
                  margin). <!-- means what? --></p>
               <p>To overcome the inherent limitations of the existing <gi>zone</gi> and
                     <gi>surface</gi> elements, we need to extend their capability to include the
                  definition of arbitrary polygons, using an attribute
		  such as <att>svg:points</att>, from the Standard
		  Vector Graphics (SVG) XML namespace. This  would
		  also provide a way of defining a baseline for the writing. This work is not
                  yet fully elaborated. </p>
               <p>The attribute <att>stage</att> is used to indicate the <term>stage</term> in a
                  writing campaign to which this zone has been assigned by the encoder, as further
                  discussed in <ptr target="#stages"/> below. </p>
               <p>Within a zone, individual lines of writing are usually, but not necessarily,
                  distinguished using the <gi>ge:line</gi>. Zones can
		  also include <gi>table</gi>
                  elements, as lines and tables represent the principal ways of organising
                  texts on a surface.<!--note>Can we have <gi>cell</gi> restricted to contain only what
                     is allowed within <gi>ge:line</gi>? Namely: <specList>
                        <specDesc key="model.pPart.transcriptional"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.pPart.editorial"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.hiLike"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.gLike"/>
                        <specDesc key="model.global"/>
                     </specList>
                  </note--> In the case of an interlineated text, interlinear writing can be treated as a
                  line on its own (perhaps characterised by a <att>type</att> attribute) or as
                  textual addition, encoded with an <gi>add</gi> (see below <ptr
                     target="#alterations"/>).<!-- more discussion
	       needed --></p>
               <p>In the following imaginary example, there are two main areas of writing, the diary
                  entry (black ink) and another (supposedly later) annotation in blue ink. <figure>
                     <graphic url="examples/D1.png" width="400px"/>
                  </figure> Note that the diary entry forms a zone which itself contains two zones:
                  one containing the date, and the other containing three lines about birds. The
                  five lines of annotation in blue ink form another zone, to record which the diary
                  page has been rotated 90° clockwise by the author. Using the elements discussed so
                  far, the page might be transcribed as follows:</p>

               <!--<p>[We need here an example discussing problem of interlinear markup
]</p>-->
               <p>Is it possible to combine both perspectives (documentary and textual views) within
                  a single encoding? In general a document-based transcription, which is done
                  page-by-page and possibly line-by-line, is almost certain to overlap with some
                  part of a the text-based structure. The cleanest solution may be to encode both
                  structures separately, providing both a <gi>ge:document</gi> and a distinct
                     <gi>text</gi> solution, perhaps using some form of external pointing to link
                  the two, and minimizing redundancy of encoding by using XInclude. This option is
                  further discussed below and also in the TEI Guidelines. </p>
               <p>A further, and possibly simpler, approach is to apply to the textual elements such
                  as <gi>p</gi> exactly the same kind of <soCalled>flattening</soCalled> approach as
                  has been applied to the <gi>ge:line</gi> elements in the preceding example.
                  Instead of marking the textual paragraphs as full elements, we mark only their
                  frontiers, using the standard TEI <gi>milestone</gi> element, with the addition of
                  a spanning attribute, as follows: <!-- D1_4.xml --><egXML

               <p>Elements <gi>zone</gi>,  <gi>ge:line</gi>, and
	       <gi>cell</gi> may all contain a selection of the phrase
                  level elements which have been considered essential to a document based
                  transcription. These elements are all drawn from the
		  following existing TEI classes: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="model.pPart.transcriptional"/>
                     <specDesc key="model.pPart.editorial"/>
                     <specDesc key="model.hiLike"/>
                     <specDesc key="model.gLike"/>
                     <specDesc key="model.global"/>
                  </specList> A subset of the elements provided by
		  these classes needs to be defined. In addition, a
		  mechanism is needed to constrain the content of the
		  selected elements such that they contain only
		  elements which are allowed within <gi>ge:line</gi>.
<!-- TODO: refer to model.zonePart/linePart as an extension point for the content model -->
<!--                  <note place="foot">Can we limit the content of seg within this specific context?
                     Or do we need another element with such a content? This is point is left open
                     for the Council to evaluate.</note--> The generic
<gi>seg</gi> element can  also be used to
                  encode any semantic aspect of the transcribed document (e.g. dates or names), though
                  it is recommended that such an approach is kept to a minimum. In case extensive
                  semantic markup is to be applied, the textual perspective should be preferred or
                  included alongside, as suggested above. </p>
               <p>The written surfaces of which a document is composed are not always homogenous. In
                  the following example, taken from the Walt Whitman archive, two pieces of
                  newsprint have been glued to a piece of blue paper on which a poem is being
                  drafted: <figure>
                     <graphic url="examples/whitman01.jpg" width="400px"/>
                     <head rend="it">Image from
                        http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/duk.00258.001.jpg</head>
                  </figure> The two pieces of newsprint might perhaps be regarded as special kinds
                  of zone, but they are effectively new surfaces, since they might contain
                  additional written zones themselves (such as the numbers in this case). We
                  therefore propose a distinct element, <gi>ge:patch</gi>, which can appear within a
                     <gi>surface</gi>, and behaves effectively like one, except that it contains
                  specialized attributes to provide additional information. <specList>
                     <specDesc key="patch" atts="binder type height width"/>
                  </specList> Using this element, the Whitman draft above might be encoded as
                  follows: <!-- whitman01.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  discussed below (<ptr target="#mm"/>)</p>
               <p>Surfaces can also be damaged, perforated, and cut. In such cases a combination of
                     <gi>damageSpan</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements may be used. <specList>
                     <specDesc key="damageSpan" atts="group"/>
                     <specDesc key="gap"/>
                  </specList> Suppose that a piece of paper has been cut from the page
                  encoded by a <gi>surface</gi> element, and that we can infer the dimensions of the
                  missing piece. This could be encoded as follows: <!-- damageSpan_1.xml --><egXML
                     xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
                        <zone>...</zone>
                        <damageSpan hand="#author" spanTo="#zoneEnd" agent="knife_or_scissors"
                           group="1" extent="3x5" unit="cm"/>
                        <zone ulx="9" uly="20" lrx="70" lry="60"/>
                        <anchor xml:id="zoneEnd"/>
                     </surface>
                  </egXML> In the example an empty <gi>zone</gi> element has been provided in order
                  to give the coordinates of the missing piece of <gi>surface</gi>, assuming that
                  those are reconstructible. If a full page is missing, <gi>damageSpan</gi> can be
                  used within <gi>ge:document</gi>, perhaps in conjunction with a <gi>gap</gi>
                  element. <!-- damageSpan_2.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <ge:document>
                        <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
                           <zone>...</zone>
                        </surface>
                        <damageSpan spanTo="#p3"/>
                        <gap extent="1" unit="folio">

                        <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300" xml:id="p3">

                     </ge:document>
                  </egXML> Now suppose that the missing folio is by chance found somewhere; in this
                  case it is likely that the editor might want to encode the two statuses of the
                  document, before and after the damage, tracing the genesis of the document as well
                  as the genesis of the text. In this case, the same mechanism used to
                  describe the genetic history of the text can be used to describe the genesis of
                  the document (see below <ptr target="#stages"/>):  a
                     <att>stage</att> attribute linked to a
		     <gi>ge:stageNote</gi> element can identify the different
		     states in the history of the document.
                     <!-- damageSpan_3.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  </egXML> In this example, we assume that the two
		  recovered pages (i.e. both sides of the missing
		  folio) have been encoded in some separate XML
		  document which can be obtained from the URL
		  <code>folio.xml</code>. This could be referenced via
		  the <att>corresp</att> attribute, transcluded by means
		  of a <gi>ptr</gi> or included by XInclude. The
		  content could also simply be encoded
                  within the same document as  content for the
		  otherwise empty <gi>surface</gi>s). Note that the
                     <gi>damageSpan</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> belong to a second stage in the life of
                  the document; the descriptions of <val>#stage1</val> and <val>#stage2</val> can be

               <p>Traces of authorial alteration (correction, addition, deletion, etc.) are
                  frequently found within a single document, and may also be inferred when different

                  inter-document discrepancies at the dossier level should be regarded in the same
                  way as intra-document alterations. If two witnesses are collated, we may observe
                  that a word present in one is missing from the other: does it necessarily follow
                  that this is an addition or a deletion, which we would not hesitate to mark with

differentiate them because the one within a single document is

                  the document level, within a single document, complementary to the elements
                  already provided for this purpose by the TEI scheme. We discuss specifically: <list>
                     <item><soCalled>meta-marks</soCalled>, that is a kind of authorial markup
                        present in the source and indicating how it should be read; </item>
                     <item>additions, where a passage has been rewritten to fix or clarify it; </item>
                     <item>deletions, where a passage had been struck through to indicate that it
                        has been removed, or where a deletion has itself been cancelled</item>
                     <item>transpositions, where passages have been reorganized or resequenced.
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The TEI already provides the following basic elements for transcription, which
                  constitute the <ident>model.pPart.transcriptional</ident> class: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="add"/>
                     <specDesc key="app"/>
                     <specDesc key="corr"/>
                     <specDesc key="damage"/>
                     <specDesc key="del"/>
                     <specDesc key="orig"/>
                     <specDesc key="reg"/>
                     <specDesc key="restore"/>
                     <specDesc key="sic"/>
                     <specDesc key="subst"/>
                     <specDesc key="supplied"/>
                     <specDesc key="unclear"/>
                  </specList> The present proposals extend this list by adding the following
                  elements to the same class: <specList>
                     <specDesc key="mod" atts="rend type"/>
                     <specDesc key="modSpan" atts="spanTo"/>
                     <specDesc key="metaMark" atts="function  targets"/>
                     <specDesc key="used" atts="spanTo"/>
                     <specDesc key="undo" atts="spanTo"/>
                     <specDesc key="redo" atts="spanTo"/>
                     <specDesc key="rewrite" atts="cause"/>
                     <specDesc key="transposeGrp"/>
                     <specDesc key="transpose"/>

                  </specList> .</p>
               <p>Most of these elements imply a certain level of semantic
                  interpretation; for instance the usage of the <gi>add</gi> element to encode, say,
                  interlinear insertions involves a decision that the
		  interlinear text has been deliberately inserted rather
		  than simply misplaced. As discussed
above (see <ptr target="#act_vs_state"/>), the use of these elements
                  when transcribing from a documentary perspective is
		  a pragmatic shortcut. In cases where it is felt
                   desirable to keep the recording of
		  <soCalled>what is on the page</soCalled> entirely separate from
                  <soCalled>what is the editor’s
		  interpretation</soCalled> (see <ptr
		  target="#deutung"/>), we provide  two generic elements, <gi>ge:mod</gi> and
                     <gi>ge:modSpan</gi>, which can  be used to
		     record any kind of modification identified in
		     the document. These elements can be
		     categorised by means of their <att>type</att>
		     attribute, and visual aspects of their appearance
		     can be described by means of  the <att>rend</att>
		     attribute, but they provide no further
		     interpretation of the function or intention of
		     the passage so marked up.</p>
<p> Whether such a modification, for instance a struck-out passage, is
                  to be interpreted as a deletion or as some other
		  phenomenon (e.g. as being already used) should be
be expressed using the other, more semantically motivated, elements,
which function at a  different level of description.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>Additions, fixations and clarifications</head>
                  <p>A writer may sometimes rewrite material a second time without significant
                     change and in the same place. We consider this a distinct activity from
                     addition as usually defined because no new textual material results but the
                     status of existing material changes. We distinguish two variants of this:
                        <term>fixation</term> where the first version was a tentative draft which is
                     subsequently fixed, for example by inking it over; and
                        <term>clarification</term>, where the first version was badly written and
                     has been rewritten for clarity. The element <gi>ge:rewrite</gi> is provided to
                     cover both cases. </p>
                  <p>In this simple example, taken from the papers of Henrik Ibsen, the writer wrote
                     the word <mentioned>skuldren</mentioned> hastily, and then returned to it to
                     make the letter <mentioned>l</mentioned> larger and clearer: <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/skuldren.jpg" width="400px"/>
                        <head rend="it">Image from a ms of Peer Gynt, Collin 2869, 4°, I.1.1, the
                           Royal Library of Copenhagen</head>
                     </figure> We might transcribe this word as follows: <!-- skuldren.xml --><egXML
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <ge:line>... Sku<ge:rewrite cause="unclear">l</ge:rewrite>dren </ge:line>
                     </egXML>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following example, taken from a manuscript of Jane Austen's
                        <title>Sanditon</title>, shows a rewriting where a pencilled passage has
                     been fixed with ink, with some modification: <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/AusSand70.png" width="400px"/>
                        <head rend="it">Image from page 70 of the Sanditon manuscript</head>
                     </figure> In this example, Austen sees in the fixation an opportunity to
                     manipulate the text previously written, and thus changes the pencilled
                        <mentioned> could but get a young</mentioned> to the inked <mentioned>could
                        get a young</mentioned>, writing the inky <mentioned>get</mentioned> on top
                     of pencilled <mentioned>but</mentioned> and striking over with black ink the
                     pencilled <mentioned>but</mentioned>. A simple way of encoding this might be as
                     follows: <!-- AusSand70.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <ge:rewrite cause="fix" hand="#ja2" stage="#s1">Now, if we could <subst
                              stage="#s1">
                              <add>get</add>
                              <del>but</del>
                           </subst>
                           <del stage="#s1" rend="overstrike">get</del> a young Heiress</ge:rewrite>
                     </egXML> where the <att>stage</att> attribute groups the operations that belong
                     to the rewriting stage, assuming an implied previous stage (the first layer of
                     writing). If the first layer need to be addressed independently, another
                     pointer can be added to the <att>stage</att> attribute:
                        <!-- AusSand70.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <ge:line stage="#s0"> <ge:rewrite cause="fix" hand="#ja2" stage="#s1">Now...</ge:rewrite></ge:line>
                     </egXML> 
where <val>#s0</val> and <val>#s1</val> both point to the declaration
                     of such stages in the header, the first one conventionally representing the
                     first layer of writing and the second the rewriting stage. </p>
                  <!-- note that the  hand specified for the rewrite is the second one -->
                  <p>A single rewrite may not be sufficient, and it may be that the document becomes
                     almost unreadable as a result of repeated clarification. In the following
                     example, we can distinguish at least two attempts to write the letters
                        <mentioned>er</mentioned> in the word <mentioned>bægerklang</mentioned>: <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/munch01.jpg" width="400px"/>
                        <head rend="it">Image from http://www.emunch.no/tei-mm-2008/ms.html </head>
                     </figure> We might encode this by nesting the <gi>rewrite</gi> element as
                     follows: <!-- munch01.jpg --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <ge:line>ved Bæg<ge:rewrite cause="unclear" stage="#stage2">
                              <ge:rewrite cause="unclear" stage="#stage1">er</ge:rewrite>
                           </ge:rewrite> ...</ge:line>
                     </egXML> The <att>stage</att> attribute used here is discussed further below
                        (<ptr target="#stages"/>). </p>
                  <p>Metamarks and other markup-like strokes can also
		  be inked over with the same purpose as the fixation
		  or clarification of text passages. For
                     instance, in a draft version of Goethe’s Faust, a passage was struck through
                     once in pencil during one revision and then again
		     with ink during a later revision, supposedly to fixate the deletion.</p>

                  <p>We propose an element <gi>redo</gi> (the opposite

                        <ptr target="#undo"/>), which can be used to encode this process as follows:</p>

               <div>
                  <head>Deletions and marked as used</head>
                  <p>In general, deletion in a source is marked using the <gi>del</gi> or
                        <gi>delSpan</gi> element. However, it is useful to distinguish cases where a
                     passage has been <q>indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an
                        author, scribe, annotator, or corrector</q> (TEI P5, s.v. <gi>del</gi>) from
                     cases where a passage has been struck through or otherwise marked as having
                     been used or copied to another location. In this latter case, the author does
                     not intend to suppress the content, but only to mark that it has been
                     transferred or reused. The element <gi>ge:used</gi> is provided to mark this
                     kind of <soCalled>deletion</soCalled>.</p>
                  <p>The following page from the Walt Whitman archive has been crossed through to
                     indicate used material: <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/whitman02.jpg" width="400px"/>
                        <head>Page from
                           http://www.whitmanarchive.org/resources/sleepers/20051105_0650.jpg</head>
                     </figure> This page contains many internal deletions, but these should be
                     distinguished from the <soCalled>deletion</soCalled> signalled by the large
                     cross, which actually shows that the page has been transferred or re-used, not
                     deleted. </p>
                  <p>Material marked as re-used in this way often spans more than one zone or line.
                     For that reason, the <gi>ge:used</gi> element is a spanning element, indicating
                     the end of the used area by means of a <att>spanTo</att> attribute. We might
                     encode the above page as follows: <!-- whitman02.xml --><egXML

                  <head>Metamarks</head>
                  <p>By <term>metamark</term> we mean marks such as numbers, arrows, crosses, or
                     other symbols introduced by the writer into a document expressly for the
                     purpose of indicating how the text is to be read. Such marks thus constitute a
                     kind of markup of the document, rather than forming part of the text. </p>
                  <p>Unlike marginal notes or other additions to the text, meta-marks indicate a
                     deliberate alteration of the writing (e.g. <q>move this passage over
                     there</q>). We also consider as metamarks dates introduced to mark the
                     beginning of a manuscript or a revision, but not forming part of it.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>ge:metaMark</gi> element carries a <att>function</att> attribute which
                     specifies the function of the meta-mark and a <att>target</att> attribute which
                     points to the element or elements concerned. </p>
                  <p>The following example is taken from <title>Kundige bok 2</title>, a 15th
                     century legal book from the city of Göttingen, containing regulations of
                     everyday life issued by the city council <figure>

                        xml:lang="lat">lege</mentioned> ("read") in the left hand margin,
                     functioning as a metamark to indicate that this sentence forms part of the
                     regulations. A further sentence was then added, while at some later stage or
                     stages the text and also the metamark were deleted. We might encode this as

                  <p>Here are some further examples showing the use of this element, taken from the
                     manuscript drafts of Thomas Moore's <title>Lalla Rookh</title>
                     (1817)<!--, provided by Justin Tonra, NUIG-->. The first shows a simple use of
                     a metamark used to take stock of the progress of composition: <figure>

                  <p>At regular points throughout the various drafts of the work, a number occurs,
                     usually in the right margin (in this instance, "100"). These numbers result
                     from the author counting the number of verse lines he has composed to the given
                     point, and are not part of the text, but represent a stage at which Moore is
                     taking stock of the progress of his composition. </p>

                     </figure> This example demonstrates the use of a common proof-correction mark:
                     in the left margin of the page, adjacent to a group of three cancelled lines of
                     verse, the word "stet" is written. "Stet", a Latin word meaning "let it stand"
                     is commonly used by authors, editors, and proofreaders where a previous action
                     should be disregarded. In this instance, Moore is indicating that the three
                     deleted verse lines should be let stand, as evidenced by their appearance in
                     the first printed edition of <title>Lalla Rookh</title>. The word, "stet" does
                     not form part of the text, but rather declares that a certain function be
                     performed upon the text. <!-- moore03.xml --><egXML

                     </figure> In this example two alternative readings are provided, without either
                     one being prioritised or subordinated. While the author apparently first
                     composed the line "Alone before his native river -", at some later point, he
                     entertained the possibility of using the word "beside" instead of "before." In
                     the context of this manuscript, there is no indication of which word the Moore
                     favours, so the status of these words as possible alternative readings needs to
                     be encoded. The evidence of the first edition of <title>Lalla Rookh</title>
                     shows that the word "beside" was chosen, but for the purposes of encoding this
                     manuscript, the facility to encode two equally-possible alternative readings
                     needs to be available. </p>

                     Note here the use of the existing TEI element <gi>alt</gi> to indicate
                     that the three elements indicated are mutually exclusive alternates:  the word
                     <mentioned>estranged</mentioned> can be alternated with
                     <mentioned>alarmed</mentioned> (written in-line, aster
                     <mentioned>estranged</mentioned>) and <mentioned>submerged</mentioned>
                     written at the bottom of the page. Since <mentioned>estranged</mentioned> is
                     underlined, the editors argue  (loc cit pp. 155-162)
                     that  this possibility is to be preferred to the others and hence give it a
                     weight of 1.</p>

                  <p>Metamarks are commonly used in the context of <term>transposition</term>, that
                     is, the moving of words or blocks by the author to a different position using
                     arrows, asterisks or numbers, or other metamarks. One possible approach (used,
                     for instance in HNML) would be to regard such transpositions as a special kind
                     of substitution, and actually to represent the result of the transposition
                     indicated by the metamarks in the encoding, for example by considering the
                     segment previous to the transposition as deleted, and substituted by the one
                     after the transposition. </p>
                  <p>Our recommendation is to record the actual state of the witness, but in such a
                     way as to facilitate its reorganization as a distinct processing step. We
                     propose to represent the re-alignment of transposed blocks or segments by means
                     of a stand-off mechanism. The elements <gi>ge:transposeGrp</gi> and
                        <gi>ge:transpose</gi> are provided for this purpose. For example, in the
                     following extract from an Ibsen manuscript <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/ibsen01.jpg" width="400px"/>

                     </figure>, the underlined numbers 1 and 2 indicate that, although the word
                        <mentioned>bör</mentioned> precedes the word <mentioned>hör</mentioned> in
                     the text, the order of the two words should be reversed. We may encode this as
                     follows: <!-- ibsen01.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <head>Substitution</head>
                  <p>In the current model for the TEI <gi>subst</gi> element, one or more additions
                     and deletions may be combined if they are considered as representing a single
                     editorial act, a substitution. Without extension, this model could not
                     therefore include cases such as the following example taken from Thomas Moore's
                        <title>Lalla Rooke</title>
                     <figure>

                        <mentioned>thus</mentioned> remains unchanged. It seems appropriate to treat
                     all of this as a single substitution. This would require a modification to the
                     content model of <gi>subst</gi> so as to permit text along with other members

               <div xml:id="undo">
                  <head>Undoing alterations</head>
                  <p>In some cases an author indicates that an alteration is itself to be altered:
                     for example, a struck through passage may be restored via a dotted underlining,
                     or the underlining of a passage may be deleted by a wavy line. </p>
                  <!-- need a simpler example first, need to discuss relation with restore -->
                  <p>The TEI provides an element <gi>restore</gi> for one specific kind of
                     alteration to an alteration, namely the undoing of a deletion. We propose a
                     more general element, <gi>ge:undo</gi>. The element <gi>ge:undo</gi> usually
                     encloses the element (e.g. the <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi> etc.) to be undone.
                     If it appears within such an element, the implication is that only this part of
                     the parent element has been cancelled. For example, in this passage taken from
                     Giacomo Leopardi's <title>Zibaldone</title> (p. 3595), the phrase <mentioned>si
                        rechi á</mentioned> was underlined word by word, and then the underlining of
                     the word <mentioned>si</mentioned> was cancelled. <figure>
                        <graphic url="examples/leop01.png" width="400px"/>
                     </figure>This could be encoded as follows: <!-- leop01.xml --><egXML

                  <!-- not sure I remember what we said but it seems to me we decided to 
                  point from the undo to the element to be undone-->
                  <p>To make explicit the relation between the undoing act and the initial act, we
                     propose an alternative way of encoding these scribal acts, namely an empty
                        <gi>ge:undo</gi> element, which points to the
			element the effect of which is being  cancelled. If
                     more than one (not coherent) part of the deletion
		     is undone, more than one <gi>undo</gi> element
		     will be needed, and each part undone must be
		     given an identifier.</p>
                  <p>In the following example, three text stages can be identified: <list>
                        <item>s1 (initial): This is just some sample text, we need a real example. <figure>
                              <graphic url="examples/undoing1.jpg" width="400px"/>
                           </figure></item>
                        <item>s2: This is not a real example.</item>

                     </list></p>
                  <p>This can be encoded using empty <gi>ge:undo</gi> elements as follows:
                        <!-- undoing1.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     </egXML> The <att>target</att> attributes on <gi>undo</gi> point to
                     the elements representing the initial acts  (the
		     deletions) which are undone. The <att>rend</att>
		     attribute indicates the way this reversion is
		     indicated. The <att>spanTo</att> attributes
		     points to the <gi>anchor</gi> which marks the
		     point in the text where this reversion
		     finishes.  Since two non-contiguous parts
                     of the deletion are undone, there are two
		     <gi>ge:undo</gi> elements, each with the
		     appropriate attribute values.  If
		     <att>spanTo</att> is not supplied, the
		  <gi>ge:undo</gi> is understood to refer to the
		  whole of the text contained by the element indicated
		  by its <att>target</att> attribute. </p>

                  <p>The use of tags such as <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> necessarily implies that
                     the modification concerned was made at some time after the original writing. An
                     exception to this is where a false start or <soCalled>instant</soCalled>
                     correction has been identified: the author starts to write, and then
                     immediately corrects what has been written. A special mechanism is provided for
                     this case: an <att>instant</att> attribute has been introduced to
                        <ident>att.editLike</ident>, whose datatype is
                        <ident>data.xTruthValue</ident> and <code>false</code> is the default value.
                     When the value of <att>instant</att> is <code>true</code> this indicates that
                     the addition or deletion is considered to belong to the same writing stage as
                     the rest of the unmodified document, while <code>false</code> means some stage
                     later than the current stage.</p>

               <p>Since a dossier needs to be assembled from many documents, which will most
                  probably be encoded in distinct TEI documents, one way to assemble a dossier’s
                  contents for further processing would be to use the existing
                     <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element in combination with <ref
                     target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XML
		     Inclusions (XInclude)</ref>. The
		     <gi>teiCorpus</gi> construct  provides for a
		     common place to record metadata
                  regarding the organization of the dossier itself, independently of
                  the metadata regarding each particular document contained within it, which would
                  be held in a discrete TEI Header attached to that particular encoded document. The
                  XInclude mechanism provides a convenient means of managing the
                  many separate resources which are likely to be needed to constitute a complete
                  dossier. For example, supposing we have a dossier comprising three documents, each
                  of which has been encoded in its own document:</p>

               <head>Genetic Graphs</head>
               <p>Looking at the documents which constitute a given dossier, there are many types of
                  relationships which can be identified, both amongst complete documents, and
                  amongst parts of those documents, including alterations, revisions, stages and
                  other compositional phenomena. A further complexity arises if for example an
                  author chooses to correct two different versions at the same time,<note
                     place="foot">Manzoni, for instance, used to modify an old draft to see how a
                     new variant fitted with the context before copying it into a new draft.</note>.
                  We may thus need to express that two or more documents are related in different
                  ways; for instance, one document may be the sequel of another, one may have been
                  drafted at the same time as another, one may contain material or treat topics
                  related to those of another, for example a newspaper article may inspire or be
                  quoted by a given work.</p>

                  </note> A graph is a mathematical representation composed of <term>node</term>s
                  and <term>arcs</term>. Nodes represent objects, which are related: Typical objects
                  in our case are documents, document components, text stages (as defined in <ptr
                     target="#stages"/> below) or even single phenomena (acts of writing or a
                  textual alterations). Each arc between two nodes then represents a relation, 
                  in our case a genetic relation, between the two
		  objects it links. Arcs may be typed and directed to further specify the kind of
                  relationship they represent. For our purposes one can assume that a typical
                  genetic graph is directed and acyclic, because we generally expect the
                     <term>paths</term> through a genetic graph (formally defined as an ordered set
                  of nodes traversed by following its arcs) to represent genetic processes with an
                  implied chronological order. In this respect a genetic graph resembles a family tree,
                  in that there is a single terminal node,
		  representing the final or published version
                  of a text with many preceding nodes linking to it, either directly or via other
                  nodes, each of which represents draft versions of various parts. Alternatively,
                  there may be more than one final state, e. g. in the case of multiple published
                  texts or unpublished fragments.</p>
               <p>A visual representation of an exemplary genetic graph might look as follows:<figure>
                     <graphic url="examples/geneticRel.png" width="400px"/>
                  </figure></p>
               <p>What can be seen here is on a very abstract level: The nodes (drawn as rectangular
                  shapes with letters) represent parts of the dossier, the directed arcs (drawn as
                  lines with arrows) represent relationships between the parts (probably of an
                  evolutionary type). Thus the graph can be read as A and B being precursors of C, C
                  in turn leading to F, F to G, G to H, and H leading to the final state Z, which
                  additionally draws influences from E and D.</p>
               <p>All this abstract information can be encoded using the following elements (see
                  also the Guidelines chapter 19. Graphs, Networks, and Trees): <specList>

               <p>Such an abstract graph structure can be easily imported into or exported from a
                  graph database, transformed into other XML-based representations of graph-based
                  data models like <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF/XML</ref>,

               <p>With the graph’s abstract structure defined, one can now go on and specify what
                  the nodes and arcs actually represent. This is done by assigning properties to
                  them via the <att>value</att> attribute. In the example the nodes A-H point to
                  individual witnesses, D and E being an exception as they point to different parts
                  of the same witness. The node Z (the final state in our example) supposedly points
                  to the edited text and each arc’s value points to a resource, whose contents
                  comprise the <term>genetic analysis</term>, which underlies the assumed genetic
                  relations expressed in the graph.</p>

               <head>Constructing genetic graphs</head>
               <p>It is highly unlikely, that editors will construct and encoded genetic graphs by
                  hand, unless the dossier is as simply structured as the given example. Rather a
                  typical workflow might be:</p>
               <list type="ordered">
                  <item>The editor transcribes each witness in a separate TEI document.</item>
                  <item>During the transcription process phenomena of genetic relevance are
                     annotated with identifiers, that classify these phenoma as belonging to a
                     certain genetic process or that simply relates these phenomena in a
                     well-defined way.</item>
                  <item>By automatically collecting and evaluating all those annotations from all
                     transcribed documents, a preliminary graph is constructed, that can be
                     visualized and navigated.</item>
                  <item>Steps 1-3 are repeated up to the point, where the graph cannot be further
                     refined via this procedure.</item>
                  <item>Optionally, the automatically constructed graph can be annotated
                     manually.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For example in the genetic edition of Goethe’s Faust, the final text is known and
                  can therefore serve as a canonical reference system for constructing genetic
                  relations. Each verse has a unique number:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <speaker>Faust.</speaker>
                  <lg>
                     <l n="354">Habe nun, ach! Philosophie,</l>
                     <l n="355">Juristerei und Medicin,</l>
                     <l n="356">Und leider auch Theologie!</l>
                     <l n="357">Durchaus studirt, mit heißem Bemühn.</l>
                     <l n="358">Da steh' ich nun, ich armer Thor!</l>
                     <l n="359">Und bin so klug als wie zuvor;</l>
                  </lg>
               </egXML>
               <p>This makes it possible to express genetic relations
	       by using these same verse numbers to index
	       corresponding verses or ranges of verse-numbers throughout their various
	       witnesses, stages or variants. Although a genetic graph generated from
                  the coindexed verses will not be of a very fine
		  granularity, it can be a useful preliminary  base
		  for subsequent refinement. By incorporating metadata for the witnesses (especially
                  dating information) and results of collation eith other relevant information, the
                  graph can be  enriched in an iterative manner and periodically checked for
                  consistency. Finally, together with the transcriptions, collation results, and a
                  critical apparatus it can be archived as an integral part of the genetic
                  edition.</p>

            <head>*Collation and Critical Apparatus</head>
            <p>As noted <ref target="#alteration">above</ref>, not all kinds of variation within and
               between documents are equivalent. For example, most people would regard authorial
               modifications within a single draft or between subsequent drafts as having a
               different significance from modifications assigned to scribal variation within a long
               textual tradition, despite their formal similarities.</p>
            <p>When a passage has been visibly deleted in one version of a text we will generally
               mark it explicitly; if however a passage present in one version (A) is omitted in
               another (B), it may be a matter of uncertainty as to whether it has been deleted from
               B, or added to A. Even if this is certain (perhaps because the order of the two
               versions is known), the omission from B of material in A is not entirely the same
               phenomenon as an explicit deletion.</p>
            <p>The addition (or deletion) of a segment from a version is normally a deliberate act
               of the author and we would like to be able to record that in positive way; whether we
               need another set of editorial elements or we should use the same set that are used
               for transcription remains an open question. </p>
            <p>Identifying additions or deletions on the basis of a comparison of different versions
               of a text is possible, using existing TEI elements for critical editing such as
                  <gi>app</gi> and its child <gi>rdg</gi> elements. This method uses the argument
                  <foreign xml:lang="lat">e silentio</foreign>: for example, to identify that
               something is missing from a witness, all available readings must be compared, and
               there is no way of explicitly marking an absent (or additional) reading. For
               instance, the 1856 edition of <title>Leaves of Grass</title>of the 1856 omits the
               words <soCalled>all, all</soCalled> which are included in the 1881-82 version. We may
               record this as an apparatus: <!-- app.xml --><egXML
                  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions <app>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves81-82">, all, all</rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
                     </app> sleep</l>
               </egXML> but this does not indicate whether the words were deleted consciously from
               the 1856 dedition, or added in the 1881 version. Furthermore, if we decided to use
               the existing <gi>add</gi> or <gi>del</gi> elements within the <gi>rdg</gi>, for
               example: <!-- app.xml --><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions <app>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves81-82">
                           <add>, all, all</add>
                        </rdg>
                        <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
                     </app>...</l>
               </egXML> the result would be ambiguous: it might indicate that there is an explicit
               addition (for example, by interlinear or marginal interpolation) within the 1881
               text, or it might indicate that this addition appears as a result of collating the
               1881 and 1856 texts. </p>

    <div>
<head>One document is transcribed</head>
<p>If, beside the base-text which is fully transcribed, all extant witnesses
          have to be reconstructed via collation, it is essential to be able to
          distinguish alterations that happen within them and between witnesses. For
          instance, using the existing tag set we could possibly encode as follows:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <l n="22">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions<app>
     <lem wit="#Leaves81-82">
 <add>, all, all</add>
     </lem>
     <rdg wit="#Leaves56"/>
  </app> sleep</l>
   </egXML></p>
<p>Nevertheless, this might force the intended usage of <gi>add</gi> as it
          might imply that there is an addition (interlinear, marginal or wherever) on
          the edition 1881-82 (a problem which will certainly be magnified with
          manuscripts) which is not the case. -->
            <p>One solution might be to use a different element (say <gi>ge:interAdd</gi>) for
               addition implied by collation, reserving <gi>add</gi> for deletions that happen at
               the document level. Another, if all the documents have been fully transcribed, might
               be to use stand off techniques to represent the collation. This is a more promising
               possibility which the workgroup has not yet fully explored. If all the alterations
               occurring at document level are already encoded within each transcription, the
               dossier-level collation will only need to point to passages within the separate files
               and classify the types of readings resulting from the collation:

                  another and also to indicate that they are related in some way, for example that
                  one is a consequence of the other. To document this we need: <list>

                     <item>a way to characterize a stage, in itself and in relation to other

               <p>The existing element <gi>creation</gi> (within the TEI Header profile description)
                  is defined as the appropriate location for all information relating to the genesis
                  or production of a text. We modify it slightly to permit a new
                     <gi>stageNotes</gi> element which contains a number of <gi>stageNote</gi>

               <p>The  <gi>stageNotes</gi> elements
                  carries an attribute <att>ordered</att>, which can take the values
                     <code>true</code>  or <code>false</code> (the default). The attribute specifies
                  whether the order of child elements signifies a temporal order for the 
                  revision campaigns which they document. In the Faust example above, the
		   editor has asserted that the four stages distinguished are ordered chronologically
                  according to the order of the <gi>stageNote</gi> elements. Note that asserting a
                  specific order early on, though probably one of the hardest tasks in a genetic
                  analysis, can considerably reduce the encoding effort in assigning textual alterations to
                  stages during the transcription, as we will see below. For instance
                  deletions can only be assigned to a stage that follows the one in which the
                  passage being deleted was written down. Hence, having a certain order of stages put in
                  place before transcription begins, will allow the encoder to reduce verbose
                  tagging, where default assumptions based on the natural order of actions can be
                  made.</p>
               <p>If necessary, <gi>stageNotes</gi> elements can be nested hierarchically. This may
                  be helpful in two cases. Firstly one can build up hypotheses about related
                  revisions step-by-step, starting with stages of smaller coverage, whose members
                  are certainly related, and then in a subsequent pass grouping these stages in
                  turn, thereby extending their reach.</p>

                  in the previous example). Such references, along with the textual content are
                   purely documentary and do not affect the textual
		   stage associated with any element thus referred
		   to. The association of a textual component with a
		   writing stage is always made  explicitly, either by
		   pointing from the <gi>stageNote</gi>  attribute
                     <att>target</att> to one or more elements, or
		     (for preference) by pointing from the element

               <p>This simple example shows the latter of the two options: The relevant stages are

                  to them. So the whole sentence was realized in the first stage, while the
                  substitution of “house” with “mouse” happened at the second stage. <!--Here the
                  assumed ordering of the stages and default assumptions about the natural ordering
                  of the textual alterations allows to reduce the tagging considerably, as only the
                  addition has to be annotated, whereas the substitution and consequently the

               <p>Note first, that a stage, once assigned to an element, is inherited by all
                  descendents of that element, unless overridden by a subsequent assignment. So in
                  the example above the three verses are assigned to the first stage initially. The
                  writing of <mentioned>Nun</mentioned> (as part of the substitution in the first verse) takes place in
                  the second stage and is repeated or fixated in the third. Also the
                  substitution in the second verse is done repeatedly: initially it takes place in
                  the second stage, but is fixated as a whole in the third.</p>
               <p>As one can see, the interpretation of what the stage assignments mean for a
                  particular text passage and the actions upon it can be based on a number of
                  implicit assumptions and constraints which have the
		  effect of  minimizing the amount of tagging necessary. If
                  it is desired to make these presuppositions more explicit, one can differentiate between
                  acts of writing and textual alterations and accordingly between their assignment
                  to stages as follows:</p>

               <p>Here two transcriptions of the same passage are given, one from a documentary
                  perspective stressing the writing process, and one from the textual perspective
                  emphasizing textual alterations. The assignment to stages is also done
                  differently here, pointing from the stage notes to the text passages and
                  alterations in question. From  the documentary perspective, the stage
                  assignments describe the writing process, in that they specify, which segment has
                  been written when and how often. From the textual
		  perspective, the markup
                  concentrates on the order of textual alterations and
		  makes no assumptions about
                  the order of writing.</p>
