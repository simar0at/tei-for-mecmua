    <p>We refer here to <ref target="#liint">other introductory material</ref> and online study guides into the TEI and supporting technologies. 
        There is also a section that <ref target="#lipro">lists a number of exemplary TEI projects</ref>. This is not to say we agree with 
        each of the markup decisions that the project has made. The projects that we refer to however have made available a 
        sizable amount of material, have applied TEI markup based on explicit guidelines, and they make their TEI 
        sources available to the public.
