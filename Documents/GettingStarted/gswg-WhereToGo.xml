    <head>Where to go from here</head>
    <p>What you probably need to do now: do document analysis, enter data, and create or
        modify a stylesheet that helps you display the data. 2p</p>
    <p>Document analysis: study the appropriate portions of the Guidelines, perhaps sets
        of local TEI guidelines developed elsewhere, discuss this with others, get help. Urge asking for feedback. 3p</p>
    <p>Enter data: if you have your texts in another format, it may help to learn some
        regular expressions: reference elsewhere. 2p</p>
    <p>Create or modify stylesheet: serious work on xslt stylesheets is not for
        everyone. 2p</p>
    <p>Places to look for tuition. 2p</p>
