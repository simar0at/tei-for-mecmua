        <head>Text Encoding and XML</head>
        <p>Strictly speaking, one doesn't need a markup language to share or even analyze digitized
            text. Computer programs can and have been written to take as input plain text and
            to analyze or transform it in various ways. Suppose, for example, you have the entire
            text of James Joyce's <title>Ulysses</title> stored in an ASCII computer file:</p>
        <quote>
            <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
                lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,
                ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He
                held the bowl aloft and intoned:</p>
            <p>--_Introibo ad altare Dei_.</p>
            <p>[etc.]</p>
        </quote>
        <p>You can do a reasonably good job of breaking the text into its component paragraphs,
            sentences, and words based on line breaks, punctuation, and spacing. So you can produce
        word counts and concordances, calculate the average length of sentences, find interesting
        patterns of word collocation, or even generate a Joyce pastiche by stringing together random
        sentences from the text. But with only the bare text itself as data, there are many more
        things you can't easily do: search for references to people, places, or
        titles; distinguish reliably between primary text and quoted text, or direct and indirect
        speech; search for passages in a particular language, such as Latin; find text that is in verse
        rather than prose. For these tasks it is necessary to add something to the bare text, to
        mark it up: hence the need for a <soCalled>markup language</soCalled>. Using a markup
            language you can identify "Buck Mulligan" as a personal name, and perhaps associate it
            with a standard identifier. You can indicate that the second paragraph represents a
            quotation, spoken by Buck Mulligan, in the Latin language, quoted from the Tridentine Mass, and
        typographically rendered in italics in the source text.</p>
        <p>Various markup languages have been developed in the past to accomplish this kind of
            identification, but the Text Encoding Initiative and the wider computing world have
            settled on a single standard: XML, the Extensible Markup Language.</p>
