    <head>Overall structure of a TEI text</head>
    <p>To introduce the structure of a TEI document, we'll begin at the level of a smaller text fragment, and then gradually add the larger document structure around it. 
    Our example is based on the <ref target="#liprograves">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>. For educational purposes, the encoding that we will show here is slightly different 
    from the encoding applied in that project.</p>
    <p>Suppose we were to create an edition of the diary of Robert Graves. We have a facsimile of a diary page, which looks like this:</p>
    <figure>
        <figDesc>Page from the diary of Robert Graves, Oct. 10 1938</figDesc>
        <graphic url="images/graves1938-10-10.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>An initial transcription of the text might look like this:
        <eg>Oct 10 Monday
            Ghost, completing ch IX
            Dictionary with Alan.
            A lot of time goes to making 
            charcoal for 'Marthe', Beryl's 
            now using this fugon for warming 
            her attic.
            Went to Montauban with 
            David – first visit for about 
            10 days – ordered small wood for 
            Dorothy's cresset.
            Now almost always win at 
            Cambeluk: we are playing a 
            correspondence game with Harry.
            Nono broke Laura's particular 
            coffee cup,  [sketch of cup]  and she 
            her blue glass bottle given by 
            Karl.</eg>
    </p>
    <p>The first thing to remark here is that in a diary transcription we'll want to identify the date that the entry belongs to. We may also want to say that 
        this piece of text actually <emph>is</emph> a diary entry. The next thing we notice is that the netry has a heading (<q>Oct 10 Monday</q>) 
        and consists of a number of paragraphs. We introduce some XML elements and attributes to account for these facts. 
    </p>

        charcoal for 'Marthe', Beryl's

        <p>Went to Montauban with

        <p>Nono broke Laura's particular 
        coffee cup, [sketch of cup]  and she 
        her blue glass bottle given by 
        Karl.</p>
        </div>
    </egXML>
    <p>The <gi>div</gi> element is what is used to describe textual divisions. We use here the <att>n</att> attribute to indicate the date, and the 
    <att>type</att> attribute to state this piece of text is a diary entry. <gi>head</gi> is used to describe a heading, <gi>p</gi>  describes a 
        paragraph. A question might be why we don't simply indicate paragraphs by newline characters, the way many programs do (such as 
        Notepad on Windows). One reason is that different operating systems use different characters to indicate the beginning of a new line. Another 
        reason is that an accidental new line character in our source would cause a rendering application to begin a new paragraph. The best way to 
        avoid  ambiguity and to make our encoding portable between platforms is to explicitly indicate new paragraphs. We might even have indicated 
        the locations where Graves begins a new line. TEI provides the <gi>lb</gi> element for that purpose. This, as most other 
        decisions about encoding, is a matter of editorial choice. Is the beginning of a new line important enough to be retained in an edition? The TEI 
        does not prescribe editorial policies.
    </p>
    <p>Before moving on to the larger document structure, we'll add a few more refinements. Not every project will find these refinements 
        necessary, but they give an indication of the kind of phenomena TEI can handle. To begin with, the word <q>fugon</q> is a word taken 
        from Spanish, and should probably italicised in an edition. We use the <gi>foreign</gi> element to indicate this. To expain what it means, 
        we add a <gi>note</gi>. Then, there is a small drawing of a cup, which our transcription renders as <q>[sketch of cup]</q>. From the 
        transcription, no-one would know that these aren't Graves' own words. We will use a <gi>figure</gi> element and an embedded 
        <gi>figDesc</gi> (figure description) to place the description. We will indicate that <q>ch</q> is an abbreviation. And finally, we will want 
        to indicate a number of changes that Graves made in his text. We will use <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements to indicate deletions 
        and additions to the text. The result is as follows:</p>
