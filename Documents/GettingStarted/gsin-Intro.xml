    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>The article you are reading is the first installment in a series of articles that should help you getting started using TEI. 
        The following installments will appear in upcoming issues of TEI-EJ.   
        The series cannot provide a full tutorial, and it cannot explain all of the detail 
    of the underlying technologies, but it should make life a little easier for someone who is 
    confronted with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for the first time.  
    This article begins by giving a brief explanation of the TEI (<ptr target="#inovr"/>), and goes on 
        to describe what you can expect from this document (<ptr target="#indoc"/>). We then 
        discuss a number of particularly strong points of the TEI approach to text encoding  (<ptr target="#instr"/>), and 
        discuss a number of situations where you might <emph>not</emph> want to use TEI <ptr target="#innot"/>. 
        We give a first example of a complete TEI text in <ptr target="#incom"/>.</p>

        <head>TEI: a very high-level overview</head>
        <p>If you are reading this article you have probably decided, or are considering, to use the 
            TEI to create a digital version of one or more texts. 
            Someone may have told you you should do so, or you may have read 
            about other projects that used the TEI. So what is TEI, and why is 
            it important? </p>
        <p>The simplest answer to that question is that the TEI is a set of 
            guidelines for the encoding of text. Text encoding is the addition 
            of codes to text in order to make it possible for a computer to 
            process that text. Text encoding assumes, usually, that 
            you already have a text, either by manually copying it, or by using 
            an <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#ocr">OCR</gloss> program. 
            The codes that you add to the text will describe some aspect of the text: either by adding 
            information such as author or place of publication (metadata), or by characterizing 
            the role or meaning or other properties of pieces of text. The title of this chapter, 
            to give a very simple example, might be encoded as:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <head>TEI: A very high-level overview</head>
         </egXML>
        <p>You might ask why we do this. Word processing software, like Microsoft Word, can after all handle text very well without 
            us having to type codes in pointing brackets. The long answer is given <ref target="#dm">here</ref>, but a shorter answer is that 
            explicit codes are probably simple and easy to recognize, especially if there is some agreement about 
            them (that is, if there is a public standard).  And it is true that other programs can compute wordlists and 
            complex concordances, without any need for these codes, but it is only true for a single text where all text 
            should be treated the same way. Once you have multiple texts you need way to associate texts with titles, 
            and if your text consists of poetry with a prose commentary, you may want to have word counts by type 
            of text. That is to say: you need a structured representation of text properties, and that is what text encoding 
            provides.</p>
        <p>If you know something about web pages, you may think by now that text encoding is like using 
            <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#html">HTML</gloss>, the language of the web. Isn’t the <gi>head</gi> that we saw just now very much like the 
            various <gi>h1</gi>, <gi>h2</gi>, … elements that HTML uses to encode headers at various levels? And indeed, the encodings 
            that the TEI uses, make use of the same formalism that HTML uses (so-called tags between angle brackets), and some of these 
            tags it shares with HTML, such as <gi>p</gi> for paragraph and <gi>div</gi> for textual division. The formalism 
            is called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</gloss> (more about it <ref target="#tbxml">here</ref>). But what makes TEI 
            different from HTML is that the TEI provides tags for many different text types (e.g. poetry, drama, dictionaries) and 
            many different sorts of properties (to document e.g. metrical properties, or textual genesis), and that each of 
            these tags has an explicit, well-documented meaning. To give an example: you can represent a play in HTML, but 
            HTML has no special tags to indicate a speech, or a stage direction. TEI does have these, and a computer 
            program that reads a TEI representation of a play can use that knowledge, e.g. to create 
            an index of speeches by character. It couldn’t do so from an HTML representation.</p>
        <p>Your next question might be: so, once I have a TEI-encoded version of my text (i.e. an XML file 
            that uses TEI tags), can I put that text on the web? The answer is: yes you can, but not without 
            one other step. You need some sort of program that can turn your encoded text into a (collection of) web page(s). 
            Remember, during the encoding process you explicitly describe the structure of your text: the verse lines, the 
            headings, the notes, etc. But you say nothing about how you want these to be represented on the web, or how 
            you want them to be printed. There is a very good reason for this. For most texts, there is not a single best way to 
            represent their content. One of the reasons why we do text encoding is that we want to do multiple things with 
            the texts (e.g. show on the web, present a search facility that can search by chapter, index personal names, etc.); 
            for that very reason, presentation functionality is kept outside of the text. The idea is that the encoding should not be 
            created for a single application program. Programs come and go; the encoding remains.</p>
        <p>There are many programming languages that can be used to create a web page out of an XML file, but by far the 
            most common is <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</gloss>. We apply what is called an XSLT stylesheet to an XML file to 
            transform it into one or more web pages. The TEI provides a set of sample stylesheets that can handle many types of 
            text, but usually some stylesheet programming is necessary to create a suitable set of web pages for a project. The 
            amount of programming depends very much on the ambition level and the properties of the text. 
            More about XSLT <ref target="#st">here</ref> 
            (By the way, there is also another type of stylesheet, viz. <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#css">CSS</gloss> stylesheets. 
            CSS stylesheets define styles for HTML (web) pages: margins, colours, font sizes, etc.)</p>
        <p>Two more questions that often come up when discussing TEI are (1) must I create this encoding by hand? 
            And (2) can I modify the TEI encodings and add my own tags? As to the first question, the answer is: to some extent. 
            Usually, people create XML files with a program called an XML editor (more <ref target="#ed">here</ref>). Most modern XML 
            editors can help you create the encoding, based on a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#sch">schema</gloss>. The schema defines what tags 
            are allowed and where they are allowed, and the XML editor can prompt the user with a list of the allowed tags. 
            The program can also check whether the tags that are used are actually allowed, in a process called 
            validation. Some XML editors can show the definitions of these tags during editing, or adjust the layout 
            and formatting of the text based on the tags that are used. All of these help very much in making XML editing a fairly 
            straightforward process, depending on your background. </p>
        <p>As to the second question: yes, you can modify the TEI encoding when your text has properties that the existing 
            encodings really do not handle adequately. You can describe the extra tags that you need, or the ones that you 
            need to change, in a special document called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#odd">ODD</gloss>. The TEI provides a web application 
            called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#roma">Roma</gloss> which helps create such a document. Roma can also generate a schema 
            from the ODD document. That schema, as we just saw, helps you create and validate your TEI document. 
            Much more about this <ref target="#sc">here</ref>.</p>
        <p>The technologies that we have mentioned in this subsection (TEI, XML, HTML, XSLT, Schema’s, and XML editors) are 
            more or less what we will discuss in the remainder of this document. But TEI is not just a set of encodings and 
            guidelines for using them. The TEI is also an organization that maintains these guidelines, and a community of 
            users that applies the guidelines. In fact the users are the organization: the TEI is a consortium of universities, 
            libraries and research organizations, and the TEI board and council are elected by the member organizations. Using 
            TEI is taking part in the community of TEI users that meet on the TEI mailing list, in Special Interest 
            Groups, on the yearly TEI member meeting and on other occasions. </p>

        <head>What this document does, and what it doesn't</head>
        <p>If you have toyed around with downloading computer programs, you will have read other 'getting started' documents. Usually they are one or two pages long. The getting started document
            that you are reading now is about 50 pages. long. That means that, depending on your purposes, it'll probably take you longer to get started using TEI than it takes to get to use 
            your average computer program. The reason for this is that learning TEI is similar - in effort and in reward - to things like learning a new language or mastering a musical instrument. 
            If you have had no previous experience of some of the more technical aspects of computing, getting to use TEI is going to present you with a sometimes steep learning curve. But then, 
            having learned to use TEI will not just enable you to encode, present and analyse your documents, you will also have acquired a deeper understanding of your texts, and text in general, 
            you will have mastered a set of technologies that will be of use throughout your professional life, and you will have met with a crowd of friendly and innovative scholars and programmers 
        that may also prove to be an asset in your career as well as a reward in itself.</p>
        <p>So, recognising that learning TEI is never going to be easy, this document will help you getting started. It is not a full course. We list online training opportunities in <ptr target="#li"/>. 
            Neither can it provide a substantive tutorial in the main technologies that TEI uses, such as <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</gloss>, <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</gloss> 
            and <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#html">HTML</gloss>. We refer to tutorials elsewhere wherever possible.</p>
        <p>The document aims to serve a diverse audience. Its readers may include academics (postgraduate, PhD, researcher, professor) who want to start understanding and using 
            the TEI: e.g. a graduate student who wants to make an edition of a book he/she is writing a thesis on. The audience may also include people who are not themselves scholars but who 
            are, or will be, working as encoders with a project. These may be undergraduates, editorial assistants, etc. We assume readers that are willing to learn something new, ready 
            to work hard and to try various solutions. We also assume someone that is reasonably comfortable using computers, but do not expect 
            experience in programming or previous knowledge of XML or HTML. </p>
        <p>By 'reasonably comfortable using computers' we mean, among other things, that we expect you to have basic computer skills, 
            such as create disk folders, move files, download, install and run programs, 
            and use <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#zip">zip/unzip</gloss> software. There is no point in this document trying to explain very elementary computer tasks. If you feel your basic computer skills 
            are inadequate, you may want to attend elementary computer training or study a beginner's tutorial.</p>
        <p>This document opens by discussing the question whether you should use TEI (<ptr target="#sy"/>). Much as we believe TEI is a powerful tool, there are also situations where TEI does
        not fit the bill. In this section we discuss whether TEI is appropriate to what you want to do. The next section (<ptr target="#tb"/>) describes a number of technologies that the TEI uses 
        in text encoding. We then go on to discuss (in <ptr target="#os"/>) the overall structure of a TEI text. The next section (<ptr target="#ed"/>) examines XML editing software, the principal 
            tool for creating and modifying TEI texts. Once we have an editor we can load, modify and validate TEI documents (<ptr target="#lm"/>). We use stylesheets (<ptr target="#st"/>) to 
            transform XML documents into other documents, e.g. to read them on the web. Once you have seen this, you'll want to begin using this on your own texts (<ptr target="#ot"/>). </p>
        <p>
            A final piece of technology we explain in this document is an XML schema. With schemas we describe exactly which elements can occur in a given XML document, and what elements they 
            may contain. Using the description, we can check the validity of the XML document. That is one of the reasons that we want to define schemas that closely fit the documents 
            that we are encoding. The TEI provides a mechanism for creating such schemas. We discuss schemas and that mechanism here: <ptr target="#sc"/>. What remains then is to ask what 
            to do once you have studied this document (<ptr target="#wg"/>). The document concludes with a Glossary (<ptr target="#gl"/>) and a list of Literature (<ptr target="#li"/>).  </p>
        <p>This document should be useful, irrespective of the computer platform you are using (Windows, Unix, Apple). In fact, an important reason why the TEI was created was that computer 
            files tended to be specific to a single platform. Work that scholars did to encode historic texts was lost when platforms changed. Platform independence is therefore very important 
            to the TEI. The software that we discuss in this document runs on all major platforms, though things may not look exactly the same everywhere. Where we have to describe 
            things that are specific to one or more platforms, we will clearly indicate this.</p>

        <head>Should you use the TEI?</head>
        <div>
            <head>Is your journey necessary?</head>
            <p>It may seem counter-intuitive for us to be questioning whether
                you need to use the TEI in a Getting Started guide intended to
                ease you into doing that very thing. However, it may be that
                the TEI is not the most suitable solution for what you want to
                accomplish. To be clear, you can encode any form of
                text-bearing object, and even objects that don't have any text,
                in TEI. People also use the TEI to record only metadata about
                objects. If you are undertaking a text-encoding project in
                linguistics, social sciences, library sciences, or humanities
                then it is likely that the TEI is a good fit for your needs.
                Nonetheless there are situations where, if you don't already
                have a TEI infrastructure to hand, your journey may not be
                necessary at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>Why not just HTML?</head>
            <p>Quite frequently people know that their main publication output
                will be in HTML on the web, and they question whether they
                should not just author directly in HTML. As mentioned earlier
                in this document the TEI has many more elements than HTML. Long
                experience has taught us that it is much better to describe
                what something is, rather than what it looks like. Therefore,
                while in HTML encoding you might want to display in italics
                something that is a title, emphasized, a foreign phrase, or a
                specialized term. In HTML one might mark this as in italics,
                but in TEI one would mark this with elements for titles,
                emphasis, foreign phrases, or terms. The benefit of this is the
                easy ability to repurpose the material for different uses and
                also by separating out the presentation from the encoding it
                allows one to easily change the form of presentation for all
                similar elements at a later date. For example, changing all the
                titles to be underlined instead of in italics without worrying
                about accidentally changing emphasized text.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your material like?</head>
            <p>One of the central reasons you choose not to use TEI is that
                there is an existing standard which suits your needs better.
                For example, if you are only encoding vector graphics then the
                Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) recommendation from the W3C is
                mostly likely a better choice. That said, if you are encoding
                documents which also contain vector graphics, then TEI would be
                a better choice as you can encode both the document and still
                embed the SVG inside it. This ability to be able to incorporate
                other standards as part of a TEI is one of its many strengths.
                Many other standards exist and the TEI has tried not to
                reinvent the wheel where a perfectly good one exists, instead
                allowing you to embed markup from other vocabularies in your
                TEI document where necessary. Additionally if the TEI does not
                cater for some textual phenomena important to your work, then
                it is possible to extend it (in an approved, documented, and
                conformant manner) to add new elements to deal with these.</p>
            <p>Another technology that people use frequently instead of the
                TEI, or other forms of XML, is relational databases. It makes
                sense to use a standard relational database when the nature of
                the data benefits from this form of storage and retrieval. One
                way to think about this division of information is whether it
                is data-like or document-like. Relational databases are good at
                storing single static fields where no markup is present in any
                of the fields. XML is good at deeply-nested, arbitrary, fields.
                An example might be an address and telephone list. If one is
                simply recording a flat list of names, phone numbers, and some
                address lines then a relational database is certainly
                sufficient. If the individual fields contain anything you want
                to record inside any of them then using a structured markup
                language like TEI XML is probably more suitable. So-called
                'document-like' information is often characterised by multiple
                levels of nesting of structures, for example divisions
                containing paragraphs containing various phrase-level markup
                such as names, abbreviations, or foreign phrases.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your desired output?</head>
            <p>It is one of the basic ideas of descriptive markup that the
                presentation and output should be left as a separate step from
                the encoding of the information. Part of the reason for this is
                one is able to leverage the markup available in a TEI document
                to produce all sorts of outputs. (e.g. not only a rendering of
                a text, but indices of certain aspects, rearrangements or
                different views, and any number of statistics) The TEI provides
                basic customisable XSLT stylesheets for transforming TEI texts
                to HTML and PDF, and additionally there are ways to import and
                export TEI to/from word processors. One of the benefits of
                using XML as a format is that it is fairly easy to transform
                XML into other formats required for later software as tools
                exist to do this and transformation languages are fairly easy
                to learn. That said, if your output is to be created and
                accessed in the same format, or if it contains structures which
                are not able to be represented in TEI markup, then choosing
                another format may be more suitable. Likewise if the discipline
                you are working in has a significant number of tools and
                expertise available for a format commonly used in that
                discipline this may also be a factor in the format you
                choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>Learning curves and technical support</head>
            <p>The competence of the person undertaking the encoding is
                necessarily a consideration in choosing technologies. However,
                it should be emphasized that a fairly good understanding of
                basic TEI XML can be obtained quite quickly in comparison to
                many of the other skills people learn in order to undertake
                similarly scholarly activity. Spending a few days learning TEI
                XML is an investment of time that is well worthwhile. That
                said, such an undertaking does presuppose a certain amount of
                basic computer literacy. It is worth remembering, that in some
                cases it may also be possible to outsource the required TEI
                encoding of your documents. One good reason for using the TEI,
                of course, is that there is a large international community who
                are willing to help you as you encounter new problems.
                Nonetheless, if the context in which you are undertaking the
                encoding (workplace, institution, etc.) provides no support for
                TEI or XML, and actively supports alternative solutions, then
                that should be borne in mind. What would be more beneficial, of
                course, is educate your colleagues as to the benefits of the
                TEI, and perhaps host a TEI Workshop with invited speakers to
                help train your local technical support. There are many
                scholars with basic computer literacy have been more than able
                to teach themselves the TEI.</p>

            <head>Intellectual versus practical benefits</head>
            <p>One of the many benefits of using the TEI is that you can
                intellectually specify textual distinctions that matter to you
                and are useful to your purposes. This is a lot more
                intellectually satisfying than only encoding for one platform,
                such as web distribution. And yet, if you have no experience
                with the TEI, and simply need to do a single web page very
                quickly, then deciding to learn the TEI, and investigating the
                various options for transformation to HTML, is probably not as
                practical. We would argue, of course, that learning TEI is
                never time spent poorly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>TEI and the history of digital text</head>
            <p>The TEI has a unique place in the history of the development of
                digital textual studies, digital humanities and the way we
                conceive of electronic text in a modern age. As a the TEI was
                originally a pre-web endeavour its decisions have helped to
                influence many of the people who have designed the systems,
                formats and processes which make up the web (including XML
                itself). If embarking on a text encoding project of any sort,
                it will do one no harm to examine the current TEI Guidelines.
                These guidelines are not a single publication of a small group
                of people, but they have been developed and updated over the
                last couple decades with input from countless scholars and
                experts from many fields. They have been revised again and
                again to introduce new concepts, expand older ones, and correct
                mistakes. This does not mean that there is not a long way to go
                in revising and improving the TEI Guidelines, simply that they
                have benefited from a long history of many eyes and experiences
                with all sorts of texts. The reason this should be important to
                you is that the Guidelines then provide a good resource of a
                codification of knowledge about the markup of various textual
                phenomena. It is quite likely that your problems and concerns
                are not unique and that others have encountered similar textual
                phenomena before you. After all, damage to the carving on a
                stone tablet is very similar, in a structural sense, to damage
                to a text in a medieval manuscript, or indeed a modern printed
                book rescued from a fire. </p>
            <p>While we sincerely believe that your journey is indeed worth it,
                it behoves us remind you that it may not strictly be necessary.
                It is a lot of fun though!</p>

        <head>Overall structure of a TEI text</head>
        <p>To introduce the structure of a TEI document, we'll begin at the level of a smaller text fragment, and then gradually add the larger document structure around it. 
            Our example is based on the <ref target="#liprograves">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>. For educational purposes, the encoding that we will show here is slightly different 
            from the encoding applied in that project.</p>
        <div xml:id="osfra">
            <head>A text fragment </head>
            <p>Suppose we were to create an edition of the diary of Robert Graves. We have a facsimile of a diary page, which looks like this:</p>
            <figure>
                <figDesc>Page from the diary of Robert Graves, Oct. 10 1938</figDesc>
                <graphic url="images/graves1938-10-10.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>An initial transcription of the text might look like this:
                <eg>

                    her attic.
                    Went to Montauban with 
                    David – first visit for about 
                    10 days – ordered small wood for 
                    Dorothy's cresset.

            </p>
            <p>The first thing to remark here is that in a diary transcription we'll want to identify the date that the entry belongs to. We may also want to say that 
                this piece of text actually <emph>is</emph> a diary entry. The next thing we notice is that the entry has a heading (<q>Oct 10 Monday</q>) 
                and consists of a number of paragraphs. We introduce some XML elements and attributes to account for these facts.

                </div>
            </egXML>
            <p>The <gi>div</gi> element is what is used to describe textual divisions. We use here the <att>n</att> attribute to indicate the date, and the 
                <att>type</att> attribute to state this piece of text is a diary entry. <gi>head</gi> is used to describe a heading, <gi>p</gi>  describes a 
                paragraph. A question might be why we don't simply indicate paragraphs by newline characters, the way many programs do (such as 
                Notepad on Windows). One reason is that different operating systems use different characters to indicate the beginning of a new line. Another 
                reason is that an accidental new line character in our source would cause a rendering application to begin a new paragraph. The best way to 
                avoid ambiguity and to make our encoding portable between platforms is to explicitly indicate new paragraphs. We might, in fact, even have indicated 
                the locations where Graves begins a new line. TEI provides the <gi>lb</gi> element for that purpose. This, as most other 
                decisions about encoding, is a matter of editorial choice. Is the beginning of a new line important enough to be retained in an edition? The TEI 
                does not prescribe editorial policies.
            </p>
            <p>Before moving on to the larger document structure, we'll add a few more refinements. Not every project will find these refinements 
                necessary, but they give an indication of the kind of phenomena TEI can handle. To begin with, the word <q>fugon</q> is a word taken 
                from Spanish, and should probably be italicised in an edition. We use the <gi>foreign</gi> element to indicate this. To expain what it means, 
                we add a <gi>note</gi>. Then, there is a small drawing of a cup, which our transcription renders as <q>[sketch of cup]</q>. From the 
                transcription, no-one would know that these aren't Graves' own words. We will use a <gi>figure</gi> element and an embedded 
                <gi>figDesc</gi> (figure description) to place the description. We will also indicate that <q>ch</q> is an abbreviation. And finally, we will want 
                to indicate a number of changes that Graves made in his text. We will use <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements to indicate deletions 
                and additions to the text. The result is as follows:</p>

            <head>The larger document structure</head>
            <p>Texts do not live in isolation. They are often introduced by title pages, prefaces, tables of contents and dedications; they are often 
                followed by an index, appendices, and similar material. We represent this structure by a <gi>text</gi> element that contains a <gi>front</gi>, 
                <gi>body</gi> and <gi>back</gi>. In our case, the editors of Graves' correspondence have created monthly abstracts of the diary entries. 
                These might very well have been placed in the <gi>front</gi> element. Supposing for the moment that there is no other front matter and no 
                back matter, that would give us this:

            <p>Notice, by the way, the use of <![CDATA[<!-- ...  -->]]> to write comments in XML text. Comments are used to explain something about the 
                encoding to a human reader and will usually be ignored by programs that process the XML.</p>
            <p>Apart from the texts that surround a main text, such as forewords and appendices, TEI texts are also provided with metadata, information 
                <emph>about</emph> the text. All TEI texts come with a header that contains these metadata. The element is called <gi>teiHeader</gi>. The 
                <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> are children op the top level <gi>TEI</gi> element. So the overall structure looks like this:</p>

            <p>We will not go into details here about the content of the TEI header, but show a very minimal example. Again, this is borrowed, with simplifications, from

                <p>First, we may want to make explicit the relation between the image file that we transcribed and the transcribed content. For that purpose, the TEI provides the 
                    <gi>facsimile</gi> element, stored between the <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> elements. 
                    The <gi>facsimile</gi> element describes the transcribed object in terms of <gi>surface</gi>s and (optionally) 
                    <gi>zone</gi>s within these surfaces. In our case, each surface will correspond with a diary page, and we have no need for zones. For each 
                    surface, we can define one or more <gi>graphic</gi> elements,  which wil hold information about the images of that page. The surface element is provided 
                    with an  <att>xml:id</att> attribute. From the transcription we can point at the <gi>surface</gi> using the <att>facs</att> attribute. Let's see what 
                    this looks like:</p>

                <p>You see we have added a <gi>facsimile</gi> element containing a <gi>surface</gi> for the page that we transcribed. The <gi>surface</gi> has 
                    an <att>xml:id</att> attribute. On the <gi>div</gi> element in the transcription we have added a <att>facs</att> attribute. The value of the <att>facs</att> 
                    attribute is a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#url">url</gloss>. The value '#graves1938-10-10-1' points to the element with <att>xml:id</att> attribute 
                    'graves1938-10-10-1', that is, the <gi>surface</gi> element. The <gi>surface</gi> element contains the <gi>graphic</gi> element that 
                    is an image of the current page. 
                </p>
                <p>The reason we do this is that we have now explicitly defined the relation between the transcription and the corresponding image files. Later users of the 
                    transcription will know what belongs together. What may be more important: applications that want to render the transcription will no longer need 
                    to know about the names of the image files. They can just fetch the files that are needed from the location as it is specified in the Guidelines. It is an 
                    important  step towards making general-purpose TEI applications.

                <head>Repurposeable notes about persons</head>
                <p>A further enhancement of the document's value would be to provide some explanations about the many persons mentioned, 
                    but not identified, in the diary entries. We could create <gi>note</gi> elements, the way we did to explain 
                    <mentioned>fugon</mentioned>, but most persons recur many times throughout the diary. What we'd like to have is a single explanation 
                    per person, that we can show whenever it is needed. </p>
                <p>One way to create such reusable explanations is to make use of the participant description in the TEI header. The 
                    <gi>particDesc</gi> element can contain a list of persons (a <gi>listPerson</gi> element containing <gi>person</gi>s). For each 
                    <gi>person</gi> we could, if we wanted to do so, give a structured description of a number of characteristics (sex, age, etc). But we can 
                    also limit ourselves to an informal description using a <gi>p</gi> element. Whenever a specific person occurs in the diary, we can then 
                    refer to the description of that person in the header. The element that we will use to refer to the description is the <gi>rs</gi> element. The 
                    <gi>rs</gi> element 
                    (referring string) is somewhat like a name element, but more generic: names are referring strings, but so are 
                    'her oldest son' or 'the gardener'. Which gives us something like this:

            <head>Summary</head>
            <p>We have discussed the overall structure of a TEI text. We saw that a TEI text always contains a header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>) that 
                describes that text. The text itself (<gi>text</gi>) may, in addition to the text <gi>body</gi>, contain <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> matter. 
                Additionally, a TEI encoded text may contain a <gi>facsimile</gi> element that relates the transcription to the pages that have been 
                transcribed and to images of that pages. The transcription itself is usually structured using <gi>div</gi> element for the textual divisions, 
                which in their turn will contain <gi>p</gi> elements (if we are dealing with prose). </p>
            <p>We also saw a number of extras: we identified abbreviations, we encoded additions and deletions, and annotated references to persons. As 
                said earlier, there is nothing in the TEI which obliges us to provide that information. Decisions about the whether to encode such 
                features depend, among other things, on the type of edition that is being planned, and the resources that are available. For those, however, that 
                want to encode them, the TEI provides the necessary mechanisms. </p>
            <p>But why do we provide our texts with this type  of encoding at all? Why don't we use 
                a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#wys">wysiwyg</gloss> editing environment, the way modern word processors do? The next section will discuss 
                why we believe the type of markup that we apply here is necessary for scholarly work.
