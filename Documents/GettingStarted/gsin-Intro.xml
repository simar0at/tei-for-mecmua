        <head>TEI: a very high-level overview</head>
        <p>TEI: a set of guidelines, but also a community. 4p</p>
        <p>Why you would want to use TEI; explain the term 'encoding'; XML; what
            encoding entails; using an editor; validation; what you can then do with
            your document (transform it into other representations, have it searched;
            create selections). Possibilities for interchange and interoperability. 10p.</p>

        <head>What this document does, and what it doesn't</head>
        <p>One paragraph explaining that this getting started document is more elaborate
            than many other documents with a similar name: that is because learning TEI
            is similar in effort and in reward to things like learning a new language
            or mastering a musical instrument: 1p</p>
        <p>Helps you get started, recognising that learning TEI is never going to be
            easy: 1p</p>
        <p>It is not: a full course in using xml, in tei, in xslt, in html: 1p</p>
        <p>Structure of the document. 2p</p>
        <p>Intended readership: 1p</p>
        <p>The reader is expected to have basic computer skills: create disk folders, move files, run programs, install
            programs, use unzip software. Not explain these, but just state you need the
            skills and suggest a way to acquire them. 2p.</p>
