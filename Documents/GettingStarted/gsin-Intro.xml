    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>This document should help you getting started using TEI. It cannot provide a full tutorial, and it cannot explain all of the detail 
    of the underlying technologies, but it should make life a little easier for someone who is confronted with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for the first time. 
    This section begins by giving a brief explanation of the TEI (<ptr target="#inovr"/>), it then describes what you can expect from this document (<ptr target="#indoc"/>) and explains a number of 
    conventions that we'll use here (<ptr target="#incon"/>).</p>
    <div xml:id="inovr">
        <head>TEI: a very high-level overview</head>
        <p>TEI: a set of guidelines, but also a community. 4p</p>
        <p>Why you would want to use TEI; explain the term 'encoding'; XML; what
            encoding entails; using an editor; validation; what you can then do with
            your document (transform it into other representations, have it searched;
            create selections). Possibilities for interchange and interoperability. 10p.</p>

        <head>What this document does, and what it doesn't</head>
        <p>If you have toyed around with downloading computer programs, you will have read other 'getting started' documents. Usually they are one or two pages long. The getting started document
            that you are reading now is about 50 pages. long. That means that, depending on your purposes, it'll probably take you longer to get started using TEI than it takes to get to use 
            your average computer program. The reason for this is that learning TEI is similar - in effort and in reward - to things like learning a new language or mastering a musical instrument. 
            If you have had no previous experience of some of the more technical aspects of computing, getting to use TEI is going to present you with a sometimes steep learning curve. But then, 
            having learned to use TEI will not just enable you to encode, present and analyse your documents, you will also have acquired a deeper understanding of your texts, and text in general, 
            you will have mastered a set of technologies that will be of use throughout your professional life, and you will have met with a crowd of friendly and innovative scholars and programmers 
        that may also prove to be an asset in your career as well as a reward in itself.</p>
        <p>So, recognising that learning TEI is never going to be easy, this document will help you getting started. It is not a full course. We list online training opportunities in <ptr target="#li"/>. 
            Neither can it provide a substantive tutorial in the main technologies that TEI uses, such as <ref target="#glxml">XML</ref>, <ref target="#glxslt">XSLT</ref> 
            and <ref target="#glhtml">HTML</ref>. We refer to tutorials elsewhere wherever possible.</p>
        <p>The document aims to serve a diverse audience. Its readers may include academics (postgraduate, PhD, researcher, professor) who want to start understanding and using 
            the TEI: e.g. a graduate student who wants to make an edition of a book he/she is writing a thesis on. The audience may also include people who are not themselves scholars but who 
            are, or will be, working as encoders with a project. These may be undergraduates, editorial assistants, etc. We assume readers that are willing to learn something new, ready 
            to work hard and to try various solutions. We also assume someone that is reasonably comfortable using computers, but do not expect 
            experience in programming or previous knowledge of XML or HTML. </p>
        <p>By 'reasonably comfortable using computers' we mean, among other things, that we expect you to have basic computer skills, 
            such as create disk folders, move files, download, install and run programs, 
            and use <ref target="glzip">zip/unzip</ref> software. There is no point in this document trying to explain very elementary computer tasks. If you feel your basic computer skills 
            are inadequate, you may want to attend elementary computer training or study a beginner's tutorial.</p>
        <p>This document opens by discussing the question whether you should use TEI (<ptr target="#sy"/>). Much as we believe TEI is a powerful tool, there are also situations where TEI does
        not fit the bill. In this section we discuss whether TEI is appropriate to what you want to do. The next section (<ptr target="#tb"/>) describes a number of technologies that the TEI uses 
        in text encoding. We then go on to discuss (in <ptr target="#os"/>) the overall structure of a TEI text. The next section (<ptr target="#ed"/>) examines XML editing software, the principal 
            tool for creating and modifying TEI texts. Once we have an editor we can load, modify and validate TEI documents (<ptr target="#lm"/>). We use stylesheets (<ptr target="#st"/>) to 
            transform XML documents into other documents, e.g. to read them on the web. Once you have seen this, you'll want to begin using this on your own texts (<ptr target="#ot"/>). </p>
        <p>
            A final piece of technology we explain in this document is an XML schema. With schemas we describe exactly which elements can occur in a given XML document, and what elements they 
            may contain. Using the description, we can check the validity of the XML document. That is one of the reasons that we want to define schemas that closely fit the documents 
            that we are encoding. The TEI provides a mechanism for creating such schemas. We discuss schemas and that mechanism here: <ptr target="#sc"/>. What remains then is to ask what 
            to do once you have studied this document (<ptr target="#wg"/>). The document concludes with a Glossary (<ptr target="#gl"/>) and a list of Literature (<ptr target="#li"/>).  </p>
        <p>This document should be useful, irrespective of the computer platform you are using (Windows, Unix, Apple). In fact, an important reason why the TEI was created was that computer 
            files tended to be specific to a single platform. Work that scholars did to encode historic texts was lost when platforms changed. Platform independence is therefore very important 
            to the TEI. The software that we discuss in this document runs on all major platforms, though things may not look exactly the same everywhere. Where we have to describe 
            things that are specific to one or more platforms, we will clearly indicate this.</p>
