        <p>This article is the first article in a series that should 
            help its readers getting strated in the TEI. It explains the 
            principles of text encoding and explains what to expect 
            from the promised series of articles. It examines the 
            reasons for using or not using TEI, and gives a full, 
            albeit simplified, example of a real TEI text, showing the 
            overall structure of a TEI document: header, facsimile, text 
            consisting of front, body and back, and textual divisions. 
            It also shows a number of optional extras that can help 
            explain the text (notes), reconstructing the text's 
            history (addition and deletion), or indexing the text 
            (names and person description).

    <head>Getting started using TEI: What is TEI?</head>
    <p>The article you are reading is the first installment in a series of articles that should help you getting started using TEI. 
        The following installments will appear in upcoming issues of TEI-EJ.   
        The series cannot provide a full tutorial, and it cannot explain all of the detail 
    of the underlying technologies, but it should make life a little easier for someone who is 
    confronted with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for the first time.  
    This article begins by giving a brief explanation of the TEI (<ptr target="#inovr"/>), and goes on 
        to describe what you can expect from this document (<ptr target="#indoc"/>). We then 
        discuss a number of particularly strong points of the TEI approach to text encoding  (<ptr target="#instr"/>), and 
        discuss a number of situations where you might <emph>not</emph> want to use TEI <ptr target="#innot"/>. 
        We give a first example of a complete TEI text in <ptr target="#inost"/>.</p>
    <div xml:id="inovr">
        <head>TEI: a very high-level overview</head>
        <p>If you are reading this article you have probably decided, or are considering, to use the 
            TEI to create a digital version of one or more texts. 
            Someone may have told you you should do so, or you may have read 
            about other projects that used the TEI. So what is TEI, and why is 
            it important? </p>
        <p>The simplest answer to that question is that the TEI is a set of 
            guidelines for the encoding of text. Text encoding is the addition 
            of codes to text in order to make it possible for a computer to 
            process that text. Text encoding assumes, usually, that 
            you already have a text, either by manually copying it, or by using 
            an <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#ocr">OCR</gloss> program. 
            The codes that you add to the text will describe some aspect of the text: either by adding 
            information such as author or place of publication (metadata), or by characterizing 
            the role or meaning or other properties of pieces of text. The title of this chapter, 
            to give a very simple example, might be encoded as:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <head>TEI: A very high-level overview</head>
         </egXML>
        <p>You might ask why we do this. Word processing software, like Microsoft Word, can after all handle text very well without 
            us having to type codes in pointing brackets. The long answer is given in another article in this series 
            (<ref target="#dm">The rationale of declarative markup</ref>), but a shorter answer is that 
            explicit coding gives you (the editor of the text) control over your text and its application, 
            something you don't have when you use a commercial word processor. For an office document that may be fine,   
            but for a text that you edit you probably don't want to depend on the standard facilities 
            that were created to handle business document. 
            And while it is true that there are programs that can compute wordlists and 
            complex concordances, without any need for explicit codes, that is only true for a single text where all text 
            should be treated the same way. Once you have multiple texts you need a way to associate texts with titles, 
            and if your text consists of poetry with a prose commentary, you may want to have word counts by type 
            of text. That is to say: you need a structured representation of text properties, and that is what text encoding 
            provides.</p>
        <p>If you know something about web pages, you may think by now that text encoding is like using 
            <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#html">HTML</gloss>, the language of the web. Isn’t the <gi>head</gi> that we saw just now very much like the 
            various <gi>h1</gi>, <gi>h2</gi>, … elements that HTML uses to encode headers at various levels? And indeed, the encodings 
            that the TEI uses (so-called <term>tag</term>s between angle brackets), 
            is very similar to HTML's formalism, and some of the 
            tags it shares with HTML, such as <gi>p</gi> for paragraph and <gi>div</gi> for textual division. The formalism 
            is called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</gloss> (more about it in the 
            <ref target="#tbxml">Technical Background</ref> article in this series). What makes TEI 
            different from HTML is that the TEI provides tags for many different text types (e.g. poetry, drama, dictionaries) and 
            many different sorts of properties (to document e.g. a bibliographical description, or textual genesis), and that each of 
            these tags has an explicit, well-documented meaning. To give an example: you can represent a play in HTML, but 
            HTML has no special tags to indicate a speech, or a stage direction. TEI does have these, and a computer 
            program that reads a TEI representation of a play can use that knowledge, e.g. to create 
            an index of speeches by character. It couldn’t do so from an HTML representation.</p>
        <p>Your next question might be: so, once I have a TEI-encoded version of my text (i.e. an XML file 
            that uses TEI tags), can I put that text on the web? The answer is: yes you can, but not without 
            one further step. You need some sort of program that can turn your encoded text into a (collection of) web page(s). 
            Remember, during the encoding process you explicitly describe the structure of your text, such as verse lines, 
            headings, notes, etc. But you say nothing about how you want these to be represented on the web, or how 
            you want them to be printed. There is a very good reason for this. For most texts, there is not a single best way to 
            represent their content. One of the reasons why we do text encoding is that we want to do multiple things with 
            the texts (e.g. show them on the web, present a search facility 
            that can search by chapter, index personal names, etc.); 
            for that very reason, presentation functionality is kept 
            outside of the text. The idea is that the encoding should not be 
            created for a single application program. Programs come and go; 
            the encoding remains.</p>
        <p>There are many programming languages and other tools that can be 
            used to create a web page out of an XML file, but by far the 
            most common is <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</gloss>. 
            We apply what is called an XSLT stylesheet to an XML file to 
            transform it into one or more web pages. XSLT stylesheets can 
            can do much more apply what one would ordinarily call 'style' to a 
            document. They can define complex transformations including sorting, 
            grouping, filtering, aggregation, and selection. The TEI provides a 
            set of sample stylesheets that can handle many types of 
            text, but usually some stylesheet programming is necessary to 
            create a suitable set of web pages for a project. The 
            amount of programming depends very much on the ambition 
            level and the properties of the text. More about XSLT 
            in the <ref target="#tbxml">Technical Background</ref>  and 
            <ref target="#st">Running stylesheets</ref> articles in this series.  
            (By the way, there is also another type of stylesheet, 
            viz. <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#css">CSS</gloss> stylesheets. 
            CSS stylesheets define simpler rendering styles for XML or HTML (web) 
            pages, including things like margins, colours, font sizes, etc.)</p>
        <p>Two more questions that often come up when discussing TEI are (1) must 
            I create this encoding by hand? And (2) can I modify the TEI encodings 
            and add my own tags? As to the first question, the answer is: to some extent. 
            Usually, people create XML files with a program called an XML editor 
            (more in the <ref target="#ed">Choosing and installing an editor</ref>) 
            article in this series. Most modern XML editors can help you create the 
            encoding, based on a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#sch">schema</gloss>. 
            The schema defines what tags are allowed and where they are allowed, and 
            the XML editor can prompt the user with a list of the allowed tags. 
            The program can also check whether the tags that are used are actually 
            allowed, in a process called validation. Some XML editors can show the 
            definitions of these tags during editing, or adjust the layout and formatting 
            of the text based on the tags that are used. Some offer a tagless interface 
            for editing. All of these help very much in making XML editing a fairly 
            straightforward process, depending on your background.</p>
        <p>As to the second question: yes, you can modify the TEI encoding when your 
            text has properties that the existing encodings really do not handle adequately. 
            You can describe the extra tags that you need, or the ones that you 
            need to change, in a special document called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#odd">ODD</gloss>. 
            The TEI provides a web application called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#roma">Roma</gloss> 
            (<ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/"/>) which helps create such a document. 
            Roma can also generate a schema from the ODD document. That schema, as we just 
            saw, helps you create and validate your TEI document. Much more about this 
            in the <ref target="#sc">Defining, Creating and Using TEI Schema's</ref> article in this series.</p>
        <p>The technologies that we have mentioned in this subsection (TEI, XML, HTML, XSLT, Schema’s, and XML editors) are 
            more or less what will be discussed in the remainder of this series 
            of articles. But TEI is not just a set of encodings and 
            <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">Guidelines</ref> for using 
            them. The TEI is also an <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/">organization</ref> that 
            maintains these guidelines, and a community of users that applies the guidelines. 
            In fact the users are the organization: the TEI is a consortium of universities, 
            libraries and research organizations, and the TEI <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/About/board.xml">Board</ref> 
            and <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">Council</ref> are elected by the 
            <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Membership/">member organizations</ref>. Using 
            TEI is taking part in the community of TEI users that meet on the 
            <ref target="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tei-l">TEI mailing list</ref>, 
            in Special Interest Groups, at the yearly TEI member meeting and on other occasions. </p>

        <head>What this article series does, and what it doesn't</head>
        <p>If you have toyed around with downloading computer programs, you will have read 
            'Getting started with xyz' documents. Usually they are one or two pages long. The Getting Started-series 
            that you are reading now may be about 50 pages long. That means that, depending on your 
            purposes, it'll probably take you longer to get started using TEI than it takes to get to use 
            your average computer program. The reason for this is that you are 
            not just learning to use a computer program; you are learning a new view of 
            text, a vocabulary for expressing that view, a formalism for writing that vocabulary, 
            <emph>and</emph> a set of programs for manipulating that formalism. The effort 
            will depend on your existing skills, on your environment (do you 
            have people around that can help you in the tougher decisions) 
            and on your ambitions. Learning TEI may be in some respects similar - in 
            effort and in reward - to learning a new natural language. 
            But not everyone needs to acquire a native speaker's fluency.  
            If you have had no previous experience of some of the more 
            technical aspects of computing, 
            getting to use TEI is going to present 
            you with a sometimes steep learning curve. But then, 
            having learned to use TEI will not just enable 
            you to encode, present and analyse your 
            documents, you will also have acquired a deeper 
            understanding of your texts, and text in general, 
            you will have mastered a set of technologies 
            that will be of use throughout your professional 
            life, and you will have met with a crowd of 
            friendly and innovative scholars and programmers 
            that may also prove to be an asset in your career as 
            well as a reward in itself.</p>
        <p>So, recognising that learning TEI is never going to 
            be easy, this series of articles will help you 
            get started. It is not a full course. Neither can it 
            provide a substantive tutorial in the main technologies that TEI uses, 
            such as <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</gloss>, 
            <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</gloss> and <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#html">HTML</gloss>. 
            We refer to tutorials and online training opportunities elsewhere wherever possible.</p>
        <p>The article series aims to serve a diverse audience. Its readers may include academics 
            (postgraduate, PhD, researcher, professor) who want to start understanding and using 
            the TEI: e.g. a graduate student who wants to make an edition of a book he/she is 
            writing a thesis on. The audience may also include people who are not themselves scholars but who 
            are, or will be, working as encoders with a project. These may be undergraduates, 
            editorial assistants, etc. We assume readers that are willing to learn something new, ready 
            to work hard and to try various solutions. We also assume someone that is 
            reasonably comfortable using computers, but do not expect 
            experience in programming or previous knowledge of XML or HTML. </p>
        <p>By 'reasonably comfortable using computers' we mean, among other things, that we 
            expect you to have basic computer skills, 
            such as create disk folders, move files, download and install programs, 
            and use <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#zip">zip/unzip</gloss> software. 
            There is no point in this document trying to explain very elementary 
            computer tasks. If you feel your basic computer skills 
            are inadequate, you may want to attend elementary computer 
            training or study a beginner's tutorial.</p>
        <p>After this initial article, the following article will 
            describe a number of technologies that the TEI uses 
            in text encoding (<ptr target="#tb"/>). The series then 
            goes on to discuss (in <ptr target="#ed"/>) XML editing 
            software, the principal tool for creating and modifying 
            TEI texts. Once we have an editor we can load, 
            modify and validate TEI documents (<ptr target="#lm"/>). 
            We use stylesheets (<ptr target="#st"/>) to transform XML 
            documents into other documents, e.g. to read them on the web. 
            Once you have seen this, you'll want to begin using this 
            on your own texts (<ptr target="#ot"/>). </p>
        <p>A final piece of technology we explain in the series are XML schemas <ptr target="#sc"/>.  
            By using schemas we describe exactly which elements can occur 
            in a given XML document, and what elements they may contain. 
            Using the description, we can check the validity of the XML document. 
            That is one of the reasons that we want to define schemas that 
            closely fit the documents that we are encoding. The TEI provides 
            a mechanism for creating such schemas. What remains then is to ask what 
            to do once you have studied the series (<ptr target="#wg"/>). The 
            article series comes with a Glossary (<ptr target="getstartgloss.xml"/>) 
            of technical terms. </p>
        <p>This article series should be useful, irrespective of the computer platform you are using 
            (Windows, Unix, Apple). In fact, an important reason why the TEI was created was that computer 
            files tended to be specific to a single platform. Work that scholars did to encode 
            historic texts was lost when platforms changed. Platform independence is therefore very important 
            to the TEI. The software that we discuss runs on all major platforms, 
            though things may not look exactly the same everywhere. Where we have to describe 
            things that are specific to one or more platforms, we will clearly indicate this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="instr"> 
        <head>When to use and when not to use TEI?</head>
            <p>
                It may seem counter-intuitive for us to be questioning whether
                you need to use the TEI in a Getting Started guide intended to
                ease you into doing that very thing. However, it may be that
                the TEI is not the most suitable solution for what you want to
                accomplish. To be clear, you can encode any form of
                text-bearing object, and even objects that don't have any text,
                in TEI. People also use the TEI to record only metadata about
                objects. If you are undertaking a text-encoding project in
                linguistics, social sciences, library sciences, or humanities
                then it is likely that the TEI is a good fit for your needs.
                Nonetheless there are situations where, if you don't already
                have a TEI infrastructure to hand, your journey may not be
                necessary at all.</p>
        <div>
            <head>Why not just HTML?</head>
            <p>Quite frequently people know that their main publication output
                will be in HTML on the web, and they question whether they
                should not just author directly in HTML. As mentioned earlier
                in this document the TEI has many more elements than HTML. Long
                experience has taught us that it is much better to describe
                what something is, rather than what it looks like. Therefore,
                while in HTML encoding you might want to display in italics
                something that is a title, emphasized, a foreign phrase, or a
                specialized term. In HTML one might mark this as in italics,
                but in TEI one would mark this with elements for titles,
                emphasis, foreign phrases, or terms. The benefit of this is the
                easy ability to repurpose the material for different uses and
                also by separating out the presentation from the encoding it
                allows one to easily change the form of presentation for all
                similar elements at a later date. For example, changing all the
                titles to be underlined instead of in italics without worrying
                about accidentally changing emphasized text.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your material like?</head>
            <p>One of the central reasons you choose not to use TEI is that
                there is an existing standard which suits your needs better.
                For example, if you are only encoding vector graphics then the
                Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) recommendation from the W3C is
                mostly likely a better choice. That said, if you are encoding
                documents which also contain vector graphics, then TEI would be
                a better choice as you can encode both the document and still
                embed the SVG inside it. This ability to be able to incorporate
                other standards as part of a TEI is one of its many strengths.
                Many other standards exist and the TEI has tried not to
                reinvent the wheel where a perfectly good one exists, instead
                allowing you to embed markup from other vocabularies in your
                TEI document where necessary. Additionally if the TEI does not
                cater for some textual phenomena important to your work, then
                it is possible to extend it (in an approved, documented, and
                conformant manner) to add new elements to deal with these.</p>
            <p>Another technology that people use frequently instead of the
                TEI, or other forms of XML, is relational databases. It makes
                sense to use a standard relational database when the nature of
                the data benefits from this form of storage and retrieval. One
                way to think about this division of information is whether it
                is data-like or document-like. Relational databases are good at
                storing single static fields where no markup is present in any
                of the fields. XML is good at deeply-nested, arbitrary, fields.
                An example might be an address and telephone list. If one is
                simply recording a flat list of names, phone numbers, and some
                address lines then a relational database is certainly
                sufficient. If the individual fields contain anything you want
                to record inside any of them then using a structured markup
                language like TEI XML is probably more suitable. So-called
                'document-like' information is often characterised by multiple
                levels of nesting of structures, for example divisions
                containing paragraphs containing various phrase-level markup
                such as names, abbreviations, or foreign phrases.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your desired output?</head>
            <p>It is one of the basic ideas of descriptive markup that the
                presentation and output should be left as a separate step from
                the encoding of the information. Part of the reason for this is
                one is able to leverage the markup available in a TEI document
                to produce all sorts of outputs. (e.g. not only a rendering of
                a text, but indices of certain aspects, rearrangements or
                different views, and any number of statistics) The TEI provides
                basic customisable XSLT stylesheets for transforming TEI texts
                to HTML and PDF, and additionally there are ways to import and
                export TEI to/from word processors. One of the benefits of
                using XML as a format is that it is fairly easy to transform
                XML into other formats required for later software as tools
                exist to do this and transformation languages are fairly easy
                to learn. That said, if your output is to be created and
                accessed in the same format, or if it contains structures which
                are not able to be represented in TEI markup, then choosing
                another format may be more suitable. Likewise if the discipline
                you are working in has a significant number of tools and
                expertise available for a format commonly used in that
                discipline this may also be a factor in the format you
                choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>Learning curves and technical support</head>
            <p>The competence of the person undertaking the encoding is
                necessarily a consideration in choosing technologies. However,
                it should be emphasized that a fairly good understanding of
                basic TEI XML can be obtained quite quickly in comparison to
                many of the other skills people learn in order to undertake
                similarly scholarly activity. Spending a few days learning TEI
                XML is an investment of time that is well worthwhile. That
                said, such an undertaking does presuppose a certain amount of
                basic computer literacy. It is worth remembering, that in some
                cases it may also be possible to outsource the required TEI
                encoding of your documents. One good reason for using the TEI,
                of course, is that there is a large international community who
                are willing to help you as you encounter new problems.
                Nonetheless, if the context in which you are undertaking the
                encoding (workplace, institution, etc.) provides no support for
                TEI or XML, and actively supports alternative solutions, then
                that should be borne in mind. What would be more beneficial, of
                course, is educate your colleagues as to the benefits of the
                TEI, and perhaps host a TEI Workshop with invited speakers to
                help train your local technical support. There are many
                scholars with basic computer literacy have been more than able
                to teach themselves the TEI.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>Intellectual versus practical benefits</head>
            <p>One of the many benefits of using the TEI is that you can
                intellectually specify textual distinctions that matter to you
                and are useful to your purposes. This is a lot more
                intellectually satisfying than only encoding for one platform,
                such as web distribution. And yet, if you have no experience
                with the TEI, and simply need to do a single web page very
                quickly, then deciding to learn the TEI, and investigating the
                various options for transformation to HTML, is probably not as
                practical. We would argue, of course, that learning TEI is
                never time spent poorly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>TEI and the history of digital text</head>
            <p>The TEI has a unique place in the history of the development of
                digital textual studies, digital humanities and the way we
                conceive of electronic text in a modern age. As a the TEI was
                originally a pre-web endeavour its decisions have helped to
                influence many of the people who have designed the systems,
                formats and processes which make up the web (including XML
                itself). If embarking on a text encoding project of any sort,
                it will do one no harm to examine the current TEI Guidelines.
                These guidelines are not a single publication of a small group
                of people, but they have been developed and updated over the
                last couple decades with input from countless scholars and
                experts from many fields. They have been revised again and
                again to introduce new concepts, expand older ones, and correct
                mistakes. This does not mean that there is not a long way to go
                in revising and improving the TEI Guidelines, simply that they
                have benefited from a long history of many eyes and experiences
                with all sorts of texts. The reason this should be important to
                you is that the Guidelines then provide a good resource of a
                codification of knowledge about the markup of various textual
                phenomena. It is quite likely that your problems and concerns
                are not unique and that others have encountered similar textual
                phenomena before you. After all, damage to the carving on a
                stone tablet is very similar, in a structural sense, to damage
                to a text in a medieval manuscript, or indeed a modern printed
                book rescued from a fire. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>But can markup do justice to my text?</head>
            <p>There is a school of thought that holds that XML markup cannot do 
                justice to the phenomena that literary scholars study. 
                The main reason for these doubts are that (i) XML encodes 
                hierarchical structures, while most of the phenomena that 
                literary scholars are interested cross hierachical boundaries. 
                Quotations run across paragraph boundaries, speeches in plays 
                overlap with metrical units in poetry, and textual variation 
                is also insensitive to structural boundaries; (ii) XML encoding is often 
                perceived as inflexible and rigid, not suited to 
                represent the creative process of scholarly discovery; 
                (iii) the need to learn and consider the technicalities of XML 
                encoding is sometimes thought to be at odds with the scholarly 
                work which the encoding should after all facilitate. 
                See for a forceful statement of these criticisms e.g. 
                <ref target="#smit2006">Smith et al. (2006)</ref>. 
                Should they keep you from using TEI XML?</p>
            <p>It should not come a s surprise that we do not think so. 
                This tutorial is not the right place for an in-depth discussion of these 
                fundamental criticisms. It is true that overlap between textual 
                phenomena is a frequent cause of problems in text encoding, 
                but there are a number of ways of dealing with these problems and 
                it is not usually a major problem. As to the perception of 
                inflexibility: it is clearly unwise to begin TEI encoding of 
                a text without previous thought about the phenomena worth 
                researching and worth tagging (<ref target="#lava2006">Lavagnino 2006</ref>). However, when 
                preparing a (collection of) text(s) for publication, some measure 
                of uniformity is necessary, whether one uses XML or not. And in 
                fact the use of XML can be argued to increase flexibility, as it 
                facilitates multiple presentations of the text. Finally, while 
                it is undoubtedly true that heavily marked up text can become 
                difficult to read, this is more of an interface problem than 
                an XML limitation. The problem may be alleviated by a tagless 
                editing interface in XML editors or by applications that 
                hide the existence of XML altogether. Another solution may be the 
                use of socalled <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#som">stand-off markup</gloss>, i.e. markup that is not embedded 
                within the text that it comments on but that points to segments of
                that text. </p>
            
            <p>While we sincerely believe that your journey is indeed worth it,
                it behoves us remind you that it may not strictly be necessary.
                It is a lot of fun though!</p>

        <head>Overall structure of a TEI text</head>
        <p>To introduce the structure of a TEI document, we'll begin at the level of 
            a smaller text fragment, and then gradually add the larger document structure around it. 
            Our example is based on the <ref target="#liprograves">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>. 
            For educational purposes, the encoding that we will show here is slightly different 
            from the encoding applied in that project.</p>

            <p>The first thing to remark here is that in a diary transcription we'll

                this piece of text actually <emph>is</emph> a diary entry. The next thing we 
                notice is that the entry has a heading (<q>Oct 10 Monday</q>) 
                and consists of a number of paragraphs. We introduce some XML elements and 
                attributes to account for these facts.

            <p>An fuller explanation of <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</gloss> will be given in the <ref target="#tb">Technical Background</ref> 
                article in this series. For now, XML <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#elem">element</gloss>s suchs as 'p' (paragraph) are 
                delimited by what is called <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#tag">tag</gloss>s. 
                An opening tag looks like '&lt;p>', 
                a closing tag looks like '&lt;/p>'. In running prose, we use the 
                opening tag in discussing the element. Elements can have properties 
                attached to them by specifying <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#attr">attribute</gloss>s, as in the <gi>div</gi> 
                element in the example.</p>
            <p>The <gi>div</gi> element is what is used to describe textual divisions. 
                We use here the <att>n</att> attribute to indicate the date, and the 
                <att>type</att> attribute to state this piece of text is a diary entry. 
                <gi>head</gi> is used to describe a heading, <gi>p</gi>  describes a 
                paragraph. A question might be why we don't simply indicate paragraphs 
                by newline characters, the way many programs do (such as 
                Notepad on Windows). One reason is that different operating systems 
                use different characters to indicate the beginning of a new line. Another 
                reason is that an accidental new line character in our source would 
                cause a rendering application to begin a new paragraph. The best way to 
                avoid ambiguity and to make our encoding portable between platforms is 
                to explicitly indicate new paragraphs. We might, in fact, even have indicated 
                the locations where Graves begins a new line. TEI provides the 
                <gi>lb</gi> element for that purpose. This, as most other 
                decisions about encoding, is a matter of editorial choice. Is the 
                beginning of a new line important enough to be retained in an edition? The TEI 
                does not prescribe editorial policies.
            </p>
            <p>Before moving on to the larger document structure, we'll add a few more refinements. 
                Not every project will find these refinements 
                necessary, but they give an indication of the kind of phenomena TEI can 
                handle. To begin with, the word <q>fugon</q> is a word taken 
                from Spanish, and should probably be italicised in an edition. 
                We use the <gi>foreign</gi> element to indicate this. To expain what it means, 
                we add a <gi>note</gi>. Then, there is a small drawing of a cup, 
                which our transcription renders as <q>[sketch of cup]</q>. From the 
                transcription, no-one would know that these aren't Graves' 
                own words. We will use a <gi>figure</gi> element and an embedded 
                <gi>figDesc</gi> (figure description) to place the description. 
                We will also indicate that <q>ch</q> is an abbreviation. And finally, we will want 
                to indicate a number of changes that Graves made in his text. 
                We will use <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements to indicate deletions 
                and additions to the text. The result is as follows:</p>

        <div xml:id="oscon">
            <head>The larger document structure</head>
            <p>Texts do not live in isolation. They are often introduced by title pages, 
                prefaces, tables of contents and dedications; they are often 
                followed by an index, appendices, and similar material. We represent this 
                structure by a <gi>text</gi> element that contains a <gi>front</gi>, 
                <gi>body</gi> and <gi>back</gi>. In our case, the editors of Graves' 
                correspondence have created monthly abstracts of the diary entries. 
                These might very well have been placed in the <gi>front</gi> element. 
                Supposing for the moment that there is no other front matter and no 
                back matter, that would give us this:

            <p>Notice, by the way, the use of <![CDATA[<!-- ...  -->]]> to write comments 
                in XML text. Comments are used to explain something about the 
                encoding to a human reader and will usually be ignored by 
                programs that process the XML.</p>
            <p>Apart from the texts that surround a main text, such as forewords and 
                appendices, TEI texts are also provided with metadata, information 
                <emph>about</emph> the text. All TEI texts come with a header that 
                contains these metadata. The element is called <gi>teiHeader</gi>. The 
                <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> are children op the top 
                level <gi>TEI</gi> element. So the overall structure looks like this:</p>

            <p>Notice the 'xmlns' on the <gi>TEI</gi> element: all TEI elements are

                <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"/>. </p>
            <p>We will not go into details here about the content of the TEI header, but

            <p>The encoding that we have shown up to now is of course only a very 
                partial encoding. We will show two ways of creating a more informative

                <head>Attaching a facsimile</head>
                <p>First, we may want to make explicit the relation between the image file that 
                    we transcribed and the transcribed content. For that purpose, the TEI provides the 
                    <gi>facsimile</gi> element, stored between the <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> elements. 
                    The <gi>facsimile</gi> element describes the transcribed object in terms of <gi>surface</gi>s and (optionally) 
                    <gi>zone</gi>s within these surfaces. In our case, each surface will correspond 
                    with a diary page, and we have no need for zones. For each 
                    surface, we can define one or more <gi>graphic</gi> elements,  which wil hold 
                    information about the images of that page. The surface element is provided 
                    with an  <att>xml:id</att> attribute. From the transcription we can point 
                    at the <gi>surface</gi> using the <att>facs</att> attribute. Let's see what 
                    this looks like:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                                    ...
                                </div>
                            </body>
                        </text>
                    </TEI>
                </egXML>
                <p>You see we have added a <gi>facsimile</gi> element containing a 
                    <gi>surface</gi> for the page that we transcribed. The <gi>surface</gi> has 
                    an <att>xml:id</att> attribute. On the <gi>div</gi> element in the transcription 
                    we have added a <att>facs</att> attribute. The value of the <att>facs</att> 
                    attribute is a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#url">url</gloss>. The value 
                    '#graves1938-10-10-1' points to the element with <att>xml:id</att> attribute 
                    'graves1938-10-10-1', that is, the <gi>surface</gi> element. The 
                    <gi>surface</gi> element contains the <gi>graphic</gi> element that 
                    is an image of the current page. 
                </p>
                <p>The reason we do this is that we have now explicitly defined the relation 
                    between the transcription and the corresponding image files. Later users of the 
                    transcription will know what belongs together. What may be more important: 
                    applications that want to render the transcription will no longer need 
                    to know about the names of the image files. They can just fetch the files 
                    that are needed from the location as it is specified in the Guidelines. It is an 
                    important  step towards making general-purpose TEI applications. 
                </p>

            <div xml:id="osrefper">
                <head>Repurposeable notes about persons</head>
                <p>A further enhancement of the document's value would be to provide 
                    some explanations about the many persons mentioned, 
                    but not identified, in the diary entries. We could create 
                    <gi>note</gi> elements, the way we did to explain 
                    <mentioned>fugon</mentioned>, but most persons recur many 
                    times throughout the diary. What we'd like to have is a single explanation 
                    per person, that we can show whenever it is needed. </p>
                <p>One way to create such reusable explanations is to make use of 
                    the participant description in the TEI header. The 
                    <gi>particDesc</gi> element can contain a list of persons (a 
                    <gi>listPerson</gi> element containing <gi>person</gi>s). For each 
                    <gi>person</gi> we could, if we wanted to do so, give a structured 
                    description of a number of characteristics (sex, age, etc). But we can 
                    also limit ourselves to an informal description using a <gi>p</gi> 
                    element. Whenever a specific person occurs in the diary, we can then 
                    refer to the description of that person in the header. The element 
                    that we will use to refer to the description is the <gi>rs</gi> element. The 
                    <gi>rs</gi> element (referring string) is somewhat like a name element, 
                    but more generic: names are referring strings, but so are 
                    'her oldest son' or 'the gardener'. Which gives us something like this:

        <head>Summary</head>
        <p>In this article, we have given an overview of the TEI for those that 
            want to get started applying it. We gave a high-level overview of what 
            TEI encoding is, and explained the thinking behind the series of 
            articles of which this one is the first installment. We discussed 
            the circumstances under which applying the TEI makes sense, and 
            when it does not. Finally, we gave an extended example of the 
            overall structure of a TEI text. We saw that a 
            TEI text always contains a header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>) that 
            describes that text. The text itself (<gi>text</gi>) may, in addition 
            to the text <gi>body</gi>, contain <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> matter. 
            Additionally, a TEI encoded text may contain a <gi>facsimile</gi> 
            element that relates the transcription to the pages that have been 
            transcribed and to images of that pages. The transcription itself 
            is usually structured using <gi>div</gi> element for the textual divisions, 
            which in their turn will contain <gi>p</gi> elements (if we are dealing 
            with prose). </p>
        <p>We also saw a number of extras: we identified abbreviations, we encoded 
            additions and deletions, and annotated references to persons. As 
            said earlier, there is nothing in the TEI which obliges us to provide 
            that information. Decisions about the whether to encode such 
            features depend, among other things, on the text being edited, 
            type of edition that is being planned, and the resources that are 
            available. For those, however, that 
            want to encode them, the TEI provides the necessary mechanisms. </p>
        <p>But what exactly is XML, and why are we using it? Why do we provide 
            our texts with this type  of encoding at all? Why don't we use 
            a <gloss target="getstartgloss.xml#wys">wysiwyg</gloss> editing environment, 
            the way modern word processors do? How can we process 
            files such as the one we saw? The next installments in 
            this series will deal in depth with some of the questions 
            that we could only touch upon in this article.</p>
