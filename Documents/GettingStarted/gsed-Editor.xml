    <head>Choosing and installing an editor</head>

    <p>You can edit XML documents in many ways. Since they are essentially text documents with a

        special file extension, you can edit XML in any plain text editor, e.g. any plain text

        editor (like Notepad) that comes by default on your machine. This is an easy but quite

        painful way to edit XML, because the editor gives you no help in completing tags, is not

        context-aware and cannot check to see that your XML is valid or well-formed.</p>

    <p>Dedicated XML editors vary quite a lot in approach but try to make the process easier by

        providing XML-aware functionality. Bare in mind that XML is platform independent, therefore

        you can always change your mind and switch to another editor at anytime: your XML document

        wont lose any of its characteristics. </p>

    <p>Each XML editor has its own advantages and disadvantages, but in editing XML-like documents,

        the chief functions you will need initially are the following: <list>

            <item><label>Checking for well-formedness</label>. Does the document you are working on

                follow the basic syntax rules of XML?</item>

            <item><label>Validation</label>. Does the XML document validate against the appropriate

                DTD (if there is one)? Can it handle different types of Schemas (Relax NG, W3C

                Schema)?</item>

            <item><label>Editing help</label>. Different editors offer different kinds of help when

                editing documents: some show you which elements (or attributes) are possible in a

                given position (according to the document’s DTD), while others show you the internal

                structure of an XML document as a ‘tree’ diagram so that you can navigate quickly

                around it.</item>

        </list></p>

    <p> XML editors can look deceptively like Microsoft Word or other mainstream text processing

        programs. It can be useful for them to have some similar functionality (e.g. dictionaries),

        but it is important to understand that they are quite different, and that a good XML editor

        will concentrate on the features that XML makes possible. </p>

    <!-- <p>Point out that XML is application independent. This implies you can select an editor suited to 

        the task at hand. You don't select an editor for the document's lifetime. 2p</p>

    <p>Discuss functions that an editor can handle: syntax highlighting, assisted entry,

        content completion, validation (dtd, w3c schema, relax ng), validation as you

        type, run xslt conversions, xslt debugging. Discuss source views: code view,

        wysiwyg view, tree view. Discussion illustrated with screen shots from multiple applications. 10 p</p>-->

    <p>Discuss a number of editors: .... Mention, but discourage from, option of using plain text

        editor. 10 p</p>
