    <p>In this section we are going to walk you through what is probably you're first session editing an XML document. 
        We will assume you have installed oXygen XML editor. As explained in the previous section, you can edit TEI documents 
        in many different XML editors. oXygen however is currently a popular choice in the TEI community. Whatever editor 
        you use, it should be possible to do many of the things we will mention here. We encourage you to take the time 
        to get familiar with the editor. It will increase your confidence while working with XML. It will also save you lots of 
        time, if you know some of the shortcuts that your editor provides for actions that often recur.</p>
    <p>If you feel you are already fairly comfortable with XML editing, you can skim through this section and go to the next.</p>
    <list type="ordered">
        <item>To get started, go to <ref target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/html/lm.html">
        http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/html/lm.html</ref> and download 
            <ref target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/samples/diaryfragment.zip">diaryfragment.zip</ref>. 
            Extract the files into some folder that you have access to. You should see there two files: diaryfragment.xml 
            and graves1938-10-10.jpg. The XML file integrates the examples that we used in section 
            <ptr target="#os"/>.</item>
        <item>Open the XML file in oXygen. If (on Windows) you associated the XML file type with oXygen, you can 
        do that by double-clicking the XML file. Otherwise, start oXygen and open the file from the program.</item>
    </list>
    <p>What you see now may look like this:</p>

    <p>We will now walk through a number of this editor's features. Many of those you will also find in other editors.</p>
    <div>
    <head>Multiple views and modes</head>
    <p>Next to the main document view, you notice a number of smaller windows. They give information either about 
    the text itself or the things that are allowed at that current location in the text. They can be opened (in oXygen)
    using the Project Menu, option Views. In the image above, we notice among others an outline view. The outline view
    shows an indented view of the hierarchical structure of the XML document, including elements, identifying attributes and text.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Outline view</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-outline.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Another view is the attributes view. The attributes view shows the attributes available on the current element and their values.
    It can also be used to edit the attributes' values.</p>
    <figure>

    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-attrs.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The elements view shows the elements that the current element can contain.
    Double-clicking an element inserts it into the document at the cursor location.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Elements view</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-elements.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>While these views can offer valuable information, of course they also use space that you could use for the edited file.</p>
    <p>The edited text as it is displayed in the images we saw up to now includes the text and the XML tags. It is oXygen's standard 
    display, and it is called the text mode. There are also two other editing modes, called grid mode (useful for editing spreadsheet-like
    XML document, but not for TEI documents) and author mode. In author mode, the XML tags are hidden. The buttons that switch between the
    modes are located in he left bottom corner of the text view</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Mode switch buttons</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-modebutton.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Author mode, as we see below, formats the text in an author-friendly view, that helps the author focus on the document text rather 
    than on XML tagging. We notice that some elements have received an appropriate display: <gi>del</gi> elements are shown in red 
    and crossed out, <gi>add</gi> elements are shown in green.</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>The user can choose the amount of XML tagging that is made visible in author mode. Buttons on the toolbar can be used to switch 
    between several options.</p>
